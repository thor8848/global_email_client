�格兰皇家银行驻新加坡中国经济学家胡志鹏(Harrison Hu)表示：“如果美联储今年晚些时候加息，同时中国经济再次出现恶化，迫使中国央行采取更多宽松措施，我们会看到贬值压力再次出现。”
The PBoC’s efforts to staunch the outflows have also come at a cost to its own credibility and long-term reform goals.
中国央行遏制资本外流的努力也让其在公信力以及长期改革目标方面付出了代价。
The central bank has repeatedly said it intends to let market forces set the exchange rate and reduce capital controls that limit cross-border flows. But since last year that goal has taken a back seat to efforts to restore stability.
它曾一再表示要让市场力量来决定汇率，减少限制跨境流动的资本管制。但自去年以来，这一目标已让位于恢复稳定的举措。
Not only has the PBoC spent hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves to defend the exchange rate, it has reimposed some capital controls in an effort to discourage currency speculation. Those include restricting forex purchases by individuals and halting a programme to allow Chinese residents to invest in foreign hedge funds.
中国央行不仅耗费数千亿美元外汇储备来捍卫人民币汇率，还重新实施了部分资本管制措施，以阻止外汇投机。这些措施包括限制个人购买外汇，以及中止一项允许中国居民投资海外对冲基金的计划。
Ironically, backsliding on pro-market reforms is largely the result of the central bank’s well-intentioned but poorly communicated effort to reduce intervention. In August, when the PBoC announced changes to the way it sets the exchange rate, it framed the move as a step towards granting more influence to market forces. But as the change came at a time when market forces were certain to push the currency weaker, many foreign investors interpreted it as an act of competitive devaluation to boost exports.
具有讽刺意味的是，市场化改革的倒退在很大程度上由中国央行减少干预的努力导致——这项努力初衷虽好，但没有做好沟通工作。去年8月，中国央行宣布改革汇率形成机制，并将此举视为朝着让市场力量发挥更大作用的方向迈出的一步。但由于此次改革正值市场力量肯定会推动人民币走弱之际，许多外国投资者将之解读为以竞争性贬值来提振出口的行为。
Even at the time, many analysts said this cynical interpretation was wrong, noting that China’s trade surplus was already near record highs. But the market’s panicked response to the August move, which led to unprecedented capital outflow and a much sharper fall in the exchange rate than the central bank had anticipated, essentially forced the PBoC to return to large-scale market intervention.
即便在当时，许多分析师也表示，这种充满怀疑的解读是错误的，他们还指出中国的贸易顺差已逼近历史高位。但市场对中国央行去年8月举措的恐慌反应——导致前所未有的资本外流和远超中国央行预期的汇率跌幅——实际上迫使中国央行重新回到大规模市场干预的老路。
This intervention focused on propping up the exchange rate, further undermining the PBoC “currency war” interpretation. But even so it strengthened the broader view that the PBoC would never relinquish control of its exchange rate.
此轮干预主要聚焦于支撑汇率，这进一步削弱了关于中国央行进行“货币战”的解读。但它也强化了一个更为普遍的看法，即中国央行绝不会放弃对人民币汇率的控制。
“Recently, the central bank has focused on maintaining stability but that’s not the direction of reform. It’s more like imposing stability is an ad hoc measure,” said Zhang Bin, senior fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a think-tank that advises the government. “As for when the central bank will return to pushing forward reforms, at the moment it’s tough to say.”
“最近，央行专注于维护（汇率）稳定，但这并非改革的方向。维护汇率稳定更像是一种临时措施，”为政府献策的智库中国社会科学院(CASS)的高级研究员张斌说，“至于央行何时回归推进改革之路，目前还很难说。”
China’s overall trade with the world slumped 10.9 per cent in April from a year earlier in the latest sign of the slowdown in what has been the world’s fastest growing major economy for decades.
4月份，中国与全球总体贸易额同比下滑10.9%。对于这个几十年来全球增长最快的主要经济体来说，这是其经济放缓的又一个表象。
Chinese exports unexpectedly dropped 6.4 per cent last month year-on-year, while imports plummeted 16.2 per cent, according to customs data released on Friday.
根据周五发布的海关数据，上个月中国出口额出人意料地同比下滑6.4%，进口则同比下滑了16.2%。
Exports fell 15 per cent in March from a year earlier but most economists had predicted a strong rebound in April and Chinese state media had suggested an improvement in trade last month.
今年3月，中国出口曾同比下跌15%。不过，多数经济学家曾预计4月份中国出口会强劲反弹，而中国官方媒体也曾暗示上个月的贸易状况有所好转。
China’s trade surplus, traditionally a source of tension with major trading partners like the US and Europe, increased sharply in April to $34.1bn from $3.1bn in March.
4月份中国贸易顺差从3月份的31亿美元大幅上升至341亿美元。过去，中国对外贸易顺差通常是导致与欧美等贸易伙伴间关系紧张的因素之一。
The Chinese economy grew by 7 per cent in the first quarter, its weakest quarterly performance since the height of the global financial crisis, and annual growth last year of 7.4 per cent was the slowest in 24 years.
今年第一季度，中国经济增长率只有7%，这是自全球金融危机最严重时期以来的最弱季度表现，而去年7.4%的年度增长率则是24年来的最低增长速度。
Much of the slowdown has been concentrated in the previously overheated property sector, which has seen prices and sales transactions falling for more than a year.
中国经济的放缓，主要集中于此前过热的房地产业。目前，楼市的价格和成交量已持续下跌了一年以上。
Even before the property market peaked at the start of 2014, many of the industries that feed it — such as steel, cement and glass — were already suffering from chronic overcapacity.
即使是在楼市见顶的2014年初以前，钢铁、水泥和玻璃等许多房地产相关行业也已遭遇长期的产能过剩。
With the downturn in new real estate construction projects gathering pace, Chinese producers are turning to overseas markets to sell their excess capacity.
随着房地产新开工项目的下行趋势加快，中国生产商正转向海外市场，销售其过剩的产能。
In the four months to the end of April, Chinese steel product exports were up 33 per cent.
在截止4月底的4个月里，中国钢产品的出口量上升了33%。
China’s crude oil exports were up 500 per cent over the same period as growth in domestic energy demand slid along with a downturn in heavy industrial production.
同一时期内，随着国内能源需求增长下滑以及重工业生产的萎缩，中国原油出口增长了5倍。
A research paper published by the US Congressional Research Service this week highlighted that the size of the US’s bilateral trade deficit was seen by some in Congress as a sign of unfair economic policies in China.
美国国会研究服务中心(Congressional Research Service)本周发表的一份研究报告中特别提到，美国国会部分人士认为，美国对华双边贸易赤字的规模，表明中国正在实施不公平的经济政策。
It pointed out that there were large discrepancies between the two countries’ estimates of the size of the bilateral trade imbalance.
该报告指出，对于双边贸易失衡的程度，两国的估计存在加大偏差。
According to the US, its 2014 bilateral trade deficit with China was $342.6bn but according to China, its trade surplus with the US was $237bn or $105.6bn less.
按照美国的说法，2014年美国对华双边贸易赤字为3426亿美元。而按照中国的说法，中国对美贸易顺差为2370亿美元，比美国的估计少了1056亿美元。
The main reasons for the difference were the fact that China does not determine the final destination for exports trans-shipped through a third location, usually Hong Kong, and differences in the list value of shipments when they leave China and when they enter the US.
这一差异的主要原因，一方面是中国不能确定经第三地（通常是香港）转口的出口产品的最终目的地，另一方面则是货物离开中国时的标价与进入美国时的标价存在差异。

Voting has officially begun in Uganda's presidential and parliamentary elections, but voters are facing long lines and delayed openings at some polling stations Thursday because of late ballot deliveries.
乌干达总统和议会选举投票星期四正式开始，但由于运送选票延误，一些投票站推迟开门，选民们大排长龙。
VOA's Jill Craig reports from Kampala that many polling stations were still closed two hours after voting was scheduled to start. She said there were long lines outside some Kampala polling stations, and people who had gotten there before 7 a.m. were restless and frustrated as they waited in the heat.
美国之音记者克雷格从乌干达首都坎帕拉发来报道说，很多投票站在投票规定的开始时间两小时后还没有开门。据克雷格报道，坎帕拉的一些投票站外面排着长队，选民们早上7点以前就赶到投票站，在炎热的天气下等候，感到非常不满。
Paul Bukenya, spokesman for the Electoral Commission, told VOA that all election materials have now been distributed.

I’ll bet you’ve got a number of started or almost-started projects that you’d love to do. Perhaps you dream of starting your own business, writing a novel, learning a foreign language, or taking a qualification. Or maybe you want to get the attic cleared out, organise your files, or repaint the hallway. It could even be that you know you need to take the time to exercise, meditate or journal … but you never get around to it.
也许你正想着去学一门外语，创办自己的公司或者去考一个什么资格证，也或许你想着去找时间锻炼，找时间放松等等，但是你总是找不到这种时间。
The problem is, your life is already full, and you end up busy with all the day-to-day things, unable to find time for what you really want to do. Here are some ways to make the time that you need:
因为你的生活总是那么匆忙，时间总是那么少，以至于没时间去做自己想做的事。
Use Your First Hour
How often have you told yourself that you’ll get to your big project or your novel or your spring cleaning once everything else is done?
And how often have you reached the end of the day, and had no energy? How often has something unexpected cropped up that steals away the time you were going to spend working towards your goal?
An easy solution is to take the first hour of your day and use it for what really matters to you. Everything else can wait for just one hour.
好好利用第一个小时
多少次你对自己说，干完这件事起我就去忙自己的小说，自己的创业？多少次你发现每天结束的时候你总是那么疲惫，却还是没能做那件你想做的事？做好的办法就是好好利用每天的第一个小时，问问自己什么才是你最需要做的。

Most of us have no problem getting in our daily dose of protein-in fact, we might be consuming even more of it than we need. Studies show that the way we distribute our intake through the day can have significant effects on how it's synthesized by our muscles.
大多数人每天都能获取每日所需的蛋白质含量--事实上，我们摄入的量可能比所需量还多。研究表明我们每天什么时间段摄入蛋白质对我们的肌肉如何合成这些蛋白质有着重要影响。
Solution? Divide protein evenly among all three meals-and especially after a workout-rather than cramming it into one. Registered dietitian Elizabeth Jarrard recommends starting at breakfast, with 10 to 30 grams. Bonus: More protein in the a.m. will keep you full and help you avoid mindless midmorning snacking.
解决方案？三餐的蛋白质摄入量均摊--尤其是健身之后--而不是一次性摄入。注册营养师伊丽莎白·贾洛德建议从10-30g的早餐开始。福利：早晨摄入的蛋白质越多，饱腹感就越持久，同时还能避免盲目的早午餐零食。
Check out these 4 recipes that fall within Jarrard's parameters-no protein powders necessary.
看看下文的4个食谱，这些食谱都符合贾洛德的标准--没有必要吃蛋白粉。
1. Scrambled Egg and Veggie Breakfast Quesadillas
1. 炒鸡蛋和素玉米粉饼早餐
Protein per serving: 19 grams
每份含19g蛋白质
A cheese-free quesadilla? It's a thing! This recipe shows you how to do it right, using scrambled eggs and avocado to seal the tortillas together and adding black beans for more protein.
没有奶酪的玉米粉饼？这可是至关重要的。这一食谱教你如何正确做出这份早餐，将炒鸡蛋和牛油果一起放在玉米粉饼内，加上黑豆可获得更多的蛋白质。
2. Sweet Potato Hash With Sausage and Eggs
2.山芋香肠鸡蛋哈希
Protein per serving: 25 grams
每份含25g蛋白质
A standard egg and sweet potato hash gets a protein upgrade with the addition of chopped sausage. Everything about this dish-even the seasoning-is simple, but the parts add up to a delicious result.
加上剁碎的香肠，标准鸡蛋山芋哈希的蛋白质含量就升级了。关于这道菜的一切--即使是调味料都十分简单，但各个部分相加就构成了这道美味佳肴。
3.Homemade Healthy Breakfast Nachos
3. 自制健康玉米饼早餐
Protein per serving: 17 grams
每份含17g蛋白质
To make nachos breakfast-worthy, this recipe transforms them from a gloppy pile of melted cheese to a bright, crunchy mix of fresh ingredients. Eggs lend some extra nutrition, while Greek yogurt steps in for sour cream and gluten-free tortillas keep things wheat free.
为了使玉米饼更适宜作早餐，本食谱改变了做法：将黏黏的的融化奶酪饼变成了鲜亮的脆皮饼，饼里有各种新鲜食材。饼里的鸡蛋使早餐含有更多的蛋白质，而希腊酸奶则提供了酸奶油，无麸质玉米饼则使早餐中没有小麦的成分。
4.Baked Denver Omelet
4. 烤丹佛蛋卷
Protein per serving: 30 grams
每份含30g蛋白质
Omelets usually come with a side of ham and potatoes; this one eliminates the need for extra pans by cooking the sides right into the eggs! Use lean ham to trim the fat while keeping the protein count up.
蛋卷的一面通常含有火腿和土豆；这个食谱直接烘焙鸡蛋的一面，从而省去了再用一个平底锅的步骤！我们使用的是瘦火腿，不仅没有脂肪，而且还能保证蛋白质的含量。

FORTY-FIVE giant pandas have been born in acenter within the Wolong National Nature Reserve in southwest China's SichuanProvince in the five years since a massive earthquake wreaked havoc on thearea, according to officials.
自汶川大地震造成破坏以来的5年内，四十五只大熊猫出生在中国西南的四川省卧龙国家级自然保护区中心，根据有关部门。
The 8.0-magnitude quake happened on May 12,2008 and the death toll is estimated to have exceeded 80,000.
那次8.0级地震发生在2008年5月12日，死亡人数估计超过8万。
It also terrified Wolong's giant pandas anddamaged their facilities, though breeding of the animals continued at the ChinaGiant Panda Protection and Research Center.
它也吓坏了卧龙大熊猫，损害了他们的设施，但大熊猫的繁殖在中国大熊猫保护和研究中心继续着。
The number of births has slowed to lessthan 10 each year from more than a dozen before the quake, as the center hasfocused on the quality of each panda born, Zhang Hemin, the center's director,said before the fifth anniversary of the natural disaster.
大地震之前的过去十几年，每年出生的大熊猫不到10只，正如中心一直注重出生的每只熊猫的质量，该中心主任张和民在汶川地震五周年之前说。
"We seek to breed from the bestpairs," explained Zhang.
“我们寻求从最好的熊猫配对中繁殖品种，”张解释道。
The center is the world's largest giantpanda breeding facility, currently housing 170 captive pandas previously livingthroughout the reserve, located only 10 kilometers from the epicenter of theearthquake in Wenchuan County.
该中心是世界上最大的大熊猫繁育基地，目前容纳着170只圈养大熊猫，它们以前生活在保护区，距震中汶川仅10公里。
Following the quake, most of the pandas andstaff in the center were transferred to another breeding facility in Ya'an,some 140 kilometers from the provincial capital, Chengdu.
在地震后，大部分大熊猫和工作人员被转移到在雅安的另一个育种中心设施，距省会成都约140公里。
That facility itself fell victim to similarcircumstances when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake jolted Lushan County of Ya'an onApril 20 this year.
当今年4月20日7.0级地震发生在雅安市庐山县，基地本身也发生了类似的受损情况。
However, it remained mostly intact, withall 61 of its pandas reported safe.
然而，它仍然几乎完好无损，所有的61名大熊猫报道安全。
Meanwhile, a new center for panda breedingand research, sponsored by the government of Hong Kong Special AdministrativeRegion (SAR) has been built on less rugged terrain in Huangcaoping in theWolong reserve, with capacity to accommodate 80 captive pandas, said LiDesheng, deputy chief of the reserve.
与此同时，由香港特别行政区(香港特区) 政府赞助的一个新的熊猫繁殖和研究中心在卧龙自然保护区的黄草坪较为平坦的区域内建立，能容纳80只圈养大熊猫，保护区副局长李德生说。
The Hong Kong SAR government has also helpedbuild a rescue and disease control center in nearby Dujiangyan City.
香港特区政府也帮助在都江堰附近建立了一个救援和疾病控制中心。
The Shandong food and drug watchdog issued a public notice Saturday evening on hundreds of clues and identities linking 300 suspects to illegal deals of vaccine sales in 24 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.
山东省食药监局上周六晚发布公告，公开数百条非法疫苗案线索，以及24个省、市和自治区的300名非法买卖疫苗的嫌疑人身份。
Police have busted 21 cases in Inner Mongolia, Henan, Hebei and Shandong and arrested six suspects for the sales of problematic vaccines.
警方已在内蒙古、河南、河北、山东等地破案21起，逮捕犯罪嫌疑人6人。
Among those arrested are a mother surnamed Pang and her daughter, who were charged for illegal vaccine sales worth more than 570 million yuan ($88 million). Since 2010, the suspects purchased 25 types of vaccines from more than 100 pharmaceutical salesmen, both licensed and unlicensed and were sold to illegal agents or even local disease control and prevention centers at high prices, according to Jinan Public Security Bureau in Shandong province.
其中一名庞姓母亲和其女儿涉嫌非法贩卖疫苗，涉案金额超过了5.7亿元（折合8800万美元）。根据来自山东省济南市公安局的消息，自2010年起，该嫌疑人从100余名医药公司业务员手中购入25种疫苗，加价销给全国18个省的疫苗非法经营人员甚至疾控中心。
It is against the law in China to sell vaccines without proper licenses.
没有适当的许可证，在中国销售疫苗是违法行为。
Though produced by qualified manufacturers, the quality of the vaccines was questionable as they were not transported in approved conditions. Such vaccines have potential side-effects and can even cause disability or death if they become expired.
尽管这些疫苗是由合格的制造商生产的，但是因为没有在批准的条件下运输，所以疫苗的质量是有问题的。这种疫苗通常存在潜在的副作用，如果一旦过期，甚至可以导致残疾或死亡。
The case has been transferred to the procurators.
该案件目前已经被转移到司法机关处理。
Christmas has officially begun in Rio de Janeiro, as thousands of people turned out to see the world’s tallest floating Christmas tree and a firework display over the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon yesterday.
昨天，在罗德里戈湖畔，成千上万的人穿着节日的盛装观赏了世上最高的水上漂浮圣诞树和焰火表演，由此里约热内卢的圣诞节正式拉开了序幕。
Crowds flocked to the waterfront to watch as the 542 ton and 85 metre high structure was lit up by a dazzling display of multicoloured fireworks.
耀眼炫目、五彩缤纷的烟火表演点亮了一座重达542吨、高达85米的圣诞树结构，吸引了众多人群涌向湖边前来观赏。
The annual event, which is now in its nineteenth year, draws tourists from across the globe and is the third largest occasion in the city’s calendar.
作为里约热内卢城市日历上第三大重要活动，到今年这个年度活动已经持续了19年，每年都吸引了成千上万的世界各地游客。
Each year there is a new theme, represented by the tree’s lights, and “A Christmas Light” was chosen for 2014 - celebrating the importance of light in people's lives, symbolised by the sun, moon and stars.
每年的活动主题都各不相同。为了彰显阳光、月光和星光等灯光在人们生活中的重要作用，2014年的主题选择了树状灯光来展现，名为“圣诞之光”。
The tree itself contains 3.1 million micro bulbs, 2,150 strobe effects and 100 LED reflectors, which enable the record-beating tree to change colour and display different designs.
圣诞树上装了310万个微型灯泡、2150个闪光灯以及100个LED反光镜，确保这棵打破纪录的圣诞树能够不停地变换颜色，呈现不同的设计效果。
This year Guinness World Records has officially certified that the tree is the largest of its kind in the world.
今年，经吉尼斯世界纪录官方认证，这棵圣诞树确为世界最大。
The Christmas tree will continue to float in the lagoon until 6 January 2015, the traditional end of the holiday period.
这棵圣诞树将继续漂浮在罗德里戈湖上，直到2015年1月6日这一传统节日结束。
Fireworks illuminate the tree at Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon in Rio de Janeiro.
里约热内卢的罗德里戈湖畔，焰火与圣诞树交相辉映。
White fireworks burst over the world's highest floating Christmas tree.
白色的焰火绽放在世上最高的水上漂浮圣诞树上空。

More than 80% of California is now in a state of extreme drought, according to the latest assessment. The environmental conditions that residents are experiencing today actually began in 2011. Still, there seems to be no end in sight. Water costs are sky high, as you would expect, but Californians are paying the price in more ways than one. The state’s Central Valley agriculture industry, for example, stands to lose $1.7 billion this year as a result of what some believe is the worst drought to affect the region in 500 years. Some 14, 500 workers could lose their jobs in an area responsible for half of the state’s agriculture and five percent of the entire nation’s.
最新评估显示，加州80%的地区目前处于极度干旱中。当地居民如今正经历的环境条件实际上2011年就萌芽了。但目前仍没有缓解迹象。毫不意外，当地用水成本高得吓人，但是加州所付出的代价，并非只是用水成本这么简单。加州中央谷地(Central Valley)农业今年将面临17亿美元的损失，原因在于该地区遭遇了据称是500年以来最严重的旱灾。这一地区的农业产值占加州半壁江山，占全美农业产值的5%，大约1.45万名工人也可能因农业萧条而失业。
How will California survive? For a problem of such massive scope, the solutions will be complex, experts say. One thing is certain: technology will play a key role.
加州的出路在何方？专家表示，对于如此大范围的旱情来说，要找到解决办法不是件容易的事。但有一点是肯定的：科技将发挥重要作用。
Halla Razak is the director of public utilities for the city of San Diego. Diversifying the water supply has been a top priority, she tells Fortune, because more than 90 percent of San Diego’s water has historically been purchased from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. It became clear in 1990, when there was another drought, that the existing plan wasn’t sustainable, Razak said. It prompted officials to take a fresh look at alternatives.
圣地亚哥市公用事业部门主管哈拉?瑞扎克向《财富》杂志(Fortune)透露，水源多元化一直是该部门工作的重中之重，因为圣地亚哥的九成用水都是从南加州市政水管区（Metropolitan Water District of Southern California）购买的。瑞扎克说，1990年也出现过旱情，当时我们明确地意识到现有的计划缺乏可持续性。旱情迫使政府官员重新审视替代水源的问题。
Since 2007, per-capita water use in the San Diego region has decreased about 27 percent. Officials point to rebates, tools, and educational programs aimed at improving water-use efficiency as factors in the change.
自2007年以来，圣地亚哥人均用水量下降了27%。官员称，旨在改善用水效率的返利活动、工具和教育项目都是导致这一变化的因素。
“These are low-tech solutions, ” Razak concedes. They are not like the brand-new and pricey reverse-osmosis desalination plant now under construction. The new Carlsbad Desalination Project, the work of the private developer Poseidon Water, is expected to open this fall. It will supply roughly 50 million gallons of water per day, which is about 10 percent of what the region uses each year, Razak says.
瑞扎克承认，“这些解决方案的科技含量较低。”这些办法并非那种全新的、昂贵的高科技解决方案，例如目前正在建设的反渗透海水淡化工厂。瑞扎克还说，由私营开发商波塞冬水务公司(Poseidon Water)新建的卡尔斯巴德海水淡化项目(Carlsbad Desalination Project)有望于今秋投入使用。该工厂每日供水量约为5,000万加仑，大约是该地区年用水量的10%。
Desalination is something of a controversial topic. Though it is an established technology that has long provided drinkable water to many parts of the world, most notably the Middle East, it is also frequently criticized for its high energy demands.
海水淡化是一个具有争议性的话题。虽然这是一种成熟的技术，而且长时间以来被用于为世界很多地区提供饮用水，尤其是中东地区，但它经常因高能耗而受到诟病。
‘San Diego’s most expensive source’
“圣地亚哥最昂贵的水源”
“We’ve been desalinating water for over 100 years, ” says Peter Gleick, president of the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit that works with Fortune 500 companies on water solutions. “We know how to desalinate, but that’s not the long-term answer because it’s still extraordinarily expensive.”
非营利性组织太平洋研究所（Pacific Institute）所长皮特?格莱克表示，“我们从事海水淡化业务已经100多年了。我们对海水淡化技术了如指掌，但这并非长久之计，因为这一技术仍然非常昂贵。”该组织致力于与财富500强（Fortune 500）企业合作开发水务解决方案。
Reverse osmosis technology has helped improve desalination’s energy footprint compared with past alternatives, Gleick says. Even so, the new Carlsbad plant “will be San Diego’s most expensive source of water, ” he says.
格莱克说，与之前的技术相比，反渗透技术已帮助改善了海水淡化的能源足迹。即便如此，新建造的卡尔斯巴德工厂将“成为圣地亚哥最昂贵的水源。”
In Gleick’s view, the “more mundane” technologies that help people use water more efficiently, from efficient toilets to irrigation equipment, are far more important. “Drip irrigation is not a new technology, toilets are not new, but there are new versions that let us save a tremendous amount of water cost-effectively, ” he says. “They may not be sexy, but they’re frankly the smartest things we could be doing.”
在格莱克看来，那些“更世俗”的技术能帮助人们提升用水效率，包括节水马桶和灌溉设备在内的这些技术远比反渗透技术更为重要。“滴灌并不是什么新技术，节水马桶也不是，但是也有新的版本能够让我们以低廉的成本节约大量水资源。这些技术并不怎么吸引眼球，但它们实际上却是当前我们能够采取的最明智的办法。”
Reality always look better in slow motion. Even the most humdrum events can seem like the most dramatic moment of an action film.
慢镜头中的世界总会显得更加精彩，即使是最无聊的事也可能变得像是动作片的精彩镜头。
This certainly seems to the opinion of the 'Slow Mo Guys', who decided to wrap hundreds and hundreds of elastic bands around a watermelon, bracing themselves for the moment the combined pressure leads a dramatic explosion and red faces all around.
"slow mo guys"二人组貌似也是这吗想。他们这次决定用上百条橡皮筋捆绑一个西瓜，压力会引起西瓜爆炸，果肉满天飞。
The pair - famed for their love of slow-motion destruction - spent 20 minutes wrapping the bands around the fruit, and then recorded the action with a camera that can take 1,600 images per second.
这个二人组正是因为他们所热爱的慢镜头破坏视频而红遍网络。他们花了20分钟的时间把橡皮筋套在西瓜上，然后用每秒能拍1600张照片的照相机记录下了爆炸的瞬间。
They used a Phantom Flex camera to record the action, which provided them with high-definition footage to keep for posterity.
他们用Phantom Flex高速摄影机记录下这个画面，这台摄影机为他们记录下了高分辨率的影像资料。
The video is part of a series of slow-motion videos, 61 in total, posted by the pair on their YouTube video.
这个视频是他们一系列的慢镜头动作影片之一，他们一共制作了有61个视频，全部放在了Youtube视频网站上。
Previously they have tackled a computer with a sledgehammer, played golf with an apple, and exploded 'bottle-bombs', capturing each moment at a fraction of the pace of real life.
先前他们用一个大锤破坏了一个电脑，用苹果玩高尔夫，还有瓶子炸弹，把这些时刻当作真实生活的碎片捕捉了下来。
The pair do not go to lengths to explain their motivations or what the audience is witnessing. Instead they seem to enjoy nothing more than watching everyday objects explode in super slow motion.
这两个人从来没有想过去解释他们的动机，或者去在意哪些人会看他们的视频。事实上，他们只是享受与在慢镜头中看东西爆炸的样子。
But that is part of the beauty of science - sometimes there doesn't need to be a reason, other than watching life from a new perspective.
但这也正是科学的美妙之处：有些事情并不需要理由，只是为了从另一个角度去品味生活而已。
International terrorists, money launderers and German car buyers will have to rethink their currency options after the European Central Bank moved to make the 500 bill a thing of the past.
在欧洲央行(ECB)采取行动让500欧元面值的钞票成为历史后，国际恐怖分子、洗钱者以及德国的汽车买家将不得不重新考虑其货币选择。
While many Europeans have never set eyes on the purple notes — and few shops accept them — they have featured prominently in EU discussions about how to choke off terrorist financing, a key concern since the Paris attacks.
尽管很多欧洲人从未看到过这种紫色钞票（而且几乎没有商店接受这种钞票），但它们却在欧盟(EU)有关如何遏制恐怖主义融资的讨论中占据了突出位置。自巴黎恐袭以来，恐怖主义融资一直是人们关心的一个重要问题。
Rob Wainwright, director of European police agency Europol, has called high-denomination notes the “currency of choice” for criminal and terrorist networks, while policymakers complain that many of the bills reside not in the eurozone, but in Russia.
欧洲刑警组织(Europol)负责人罗布温赖特(Rob Wainwright)将大额钞票称为犯罪和恐怖主义网络的“首选货币”，而政策制定者抱怨称，很多大额钞票并不在欧元区内，而是在俄罗斯。
Speaking to European Parliament lawmakers in Brussels yesterday, Mario Draghi, ECB governor, gave his clearest indication yet that the note was on borrowed time, saying there was an “increasing conviction” that such notes were used for criminal purposes.
欧洲央行(ECB)行长马里奥德拉吉(Mario Draghi)昨日在布鲁塞尔向欧洲议会(European Parliament)议员发表讲话时，给出了迄今最为明确的暗示，示意这种钞票已时日无多。他说，人们“日益确信”这种钞票被用于犯罪用途。
Asked last week, Michel Sapin, France’s finance minister, said the 500 bill was “used more to conceal activities than to buy things, more used to facilitate dishonest activities than by people like you and me to get a bite to eat”.
上周，法国财政部长米歇尔萨潘(Michel Sapin)在被问到此事时表示，500欧元面值钞票“更多地是被用来掩盖一些活动、而不是购物，更多地是被用来为不诚实活动提供便利、而不是被像你我这样的人用来吃吃喝喝”。
Finance ministers last week called for a review of the notes but the decision on the 500 bill rests with the ECB. Although Mr Draghi stopped short of announcing an end to the note, an informal decision has been made to withdraw the bill, according to people briefed on the matter.
欧洲各国财长上周呼吁重新评估这种钞票，但有关500欧元面值钞票命运的决定将由欧洲央行作出。知情人士称，尽管德拉吉没有宣布取消这种钞票，但已作出了让这种钞票退出流通的非正式决定。
Taking the note out of circulation would be unpopular in Germany, which has a tradition of using high-value notes for big purchases.
这一决定将不会受到德国的欢迎，该国有使用大额钞票购买大件商品的传统。
According to a study published by Europol last year, shops often refuse to accept 500 bills. But they still account for one-third of the value of all euro bank notes in circulation.
根据欧洲刑警组织去年发表的一份研究报告，商店通常会拒收500欧元面值钞票。但这些钞票仍占所有流通欧元钞票价值的三分之一。
It highlighted the case of Luxembourg, which issued bills totalling 87.5bn in 2013, about twice its GDP, with a “significant proportion” in high denominations, although it is one of the most “cash averse” countries in the eurozone.
报告强调了卢森堡的例子，2013年，该国发行了总额875亿欧元的钞票，是该国国内生产总值(GDP)的2倍左右，其中大额钞票的“比例很高”，尽管卢森堡是欧元区最“不喜欢现金”的国家之一。
Complicating matters, Bild, Germany’s highest circulation newspaper, launched a “hands off our cash” campaign aimed at Wolfgang Sch , the finance minister, to protest at plans to limit maximum cash payments.
令情况变得更为复杂的是，德国发行量最大的报纸《图片报》(Bild)发起了一项名为“别碰我们的现金”的活动，矛头直指德国财长沃尔夫冈朔伊布勒(Wolfgang Sch )，以抗议为现金支付额设置上限的计划。
A petition on Change.org calling for the Electoral College to elect Hillary Clinton as President has earned over half of the signatures needed for it to be sent to the governing body.
一个呼吁选举人团选举希拉里为总统的请愿网站已经获得了必需签名数一半以上的签名，请愿需要足够的签名才能发送给政府。
The petition, launched on Wednesday after important]Donald Trump was elected President, important]calls for the Electoral College to “ignore their states’ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.”
这个请愿是在星期三特朗普被选为总统后发起的，它要求选举人团“忽视”本州的选票把他们自己的票投给希拉里。
Although Trump won over the 270 necessary electoral votes to secure the Presidency, Clinton narrowly earned the nation’s popular vote.
尽管特朗普赢得的选票已经超过270张保证总统位置的必要的选举人票，但是希拉里以微弱优势赢得了国家普选。
The Electoral College – which was first introduced in 1804 – is comprised of 538 electors. Each state’s number of electors is decided by its number of members in Congress, which is dependent on the state’s population. So, when American citizens cast their ballots, they aren’t directly voting for president – they’re voting for electors. This year, Trump took 279, to Clinton’s 228.
选举人团（在1804年第一次被采用）由538名选举人组成。每一个州的选举人数量由这个州在国会中的代表数量决定，而国会代表数量取决于这个州的人口数量。所以，当美国公民投票时，他们并不是直接选举总统，而是在选选举人。今年，特朗普获得了279张选举人票，希拉里228张。
Most states use a “winner-take-all” system when it comes to electoral votes, although there is no Constitutional provision or federal law that requires electors to vote a certain way. Twenty-six states and Washington, D.C., do, however, “bind” their electors to vote for the promised candidate on Dec. 19 – in this case, Trump. In many cases, “faithless electors” are forced to pay a fine if they vote against the popular choice.
对于选举人票，大部分州采用的是赢者通吃的规则，虽然并没有宪法条例或者联邦法律规定选举人的投票方式。然而在这个特定情况下26个州和华盛顿特区要在12月19日把选举人票投给许诺的候选人——特朗普。在很多情况下如果选举人不按普选的结果投票，他们将会受到惩罚。
Maine and Nebraska follow a different method, called the congressional district method, which allots two electoral votes to the popular vote winner, and additional votes for each congressional district won by the candidates.
缅因州和内布拉斯加州遵循的是不一样的方法，叫做国会选区方法，它分配两个选举人票给州普选获胜者，额外的票给国会选区。
Faithless electors have not ever reversed the presidency.
无信念的选举人还从来没有推翻过总统职位。
The Change.org petition, which was at over 500,000 signatures on Thursday afternoon, said that Clinton supporters would be happy to pay any fees accrued by those who choose to be faithless electors.
在星期四下午已经获得50万签名的请愿网站对外声明，希拉里的支持者乐于支付任何费用给这些选择成为无信念选举人的人（译者：让他们推翻总统）。
“Mr. Trump is unfit to serve,” the petition claimed. “His scapegoating of so many Americans, and his impulsivity, bullying, lying, admitted history of sexual assault, and utter lack of experience make him a danger to the Republic. Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.”
“特朗普先生不适合为美国人服务，” 请愿书声称。“他让如此多的美国人替他受罪，还有他的冲动，欺凌弱小，撒谎，公认的性侵史以及执政经验的极度缺乏会让他成为共和国的威胁。希拉里赢得了普选，她应该成为总统。”
Over 70% of 50 cities monitored had high rent-to-income ratios in June, according to a recently released report, with residents of Beijing, Shenzhen, Sanya and Shanghai spending more than 45% of their disposable personal income on rent.
一份近期发布的报告显示，6月，受监测的50个城市中超七成房租收入比较高，其中，北京、深圳、三亚和上海的居民将45%以上的个人可支配收入用于支付房租。
Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institute said in the report that Beijing took the lead, with an average monthly rent of 2,748 yuan at a ratio of 58%.
位于上海的易居研究院在报告中指出，北京的房租收入比最高，达58%，平均房租为2748元/月。
The southern manufacturing hub of Shenzhen, southern tourist destination of Sanya and eastern metropolis Shanghai followed with ratios of 54%, 48% and 48% respectively.
南部制造业中心深圳、南部旅游胜地三亚和东部大都市上海分别以54%、48%和48%的房租收入比紧随其后。
The report shows only 12 out of the 50 cities monitored have reasonable rent-to-income ratios, which are usually under 25%.
报告显示，受监测的50个城市中仅有12个城市的房租收入比合理。合理的房租收入比通常在25%以下。
A total of 34 cities were found to have rent-to-income ratios between 25% and 45%, including Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Tianjin.
报告发现，广州、杭州和天津等共34个城市的房租收入比在25%到45%之间。
Wang Mengwen, an analyst with the institute, said rental housing demand is still very high in large cities and integration of market forces and government subsidies is needed to ensure the sound development of this sector.
易居研究院分析师王梦雯表示，大城市的住房租赁需求依然非常高，为确保该领域的健康发展，需要将市场力量和政府补贴结合起来。
Will McKinsey exist in 50 years’ time? This question has lodged itself in my mind after reading a piece in the firm’s magazine that tells us what business people will be thinking about for the next half-century.
50年后，麦肯锡(McKinsey)是否还会存在？当我在该公司的杂志里读到一篇关于商界人士在接下来的半个世纪里会思考什么的文章后，这个问题占据了我的心头。
The McKinsey Quarterly is 50 years old, and it has chosen to celebrate its birthday with a momentous article based on many years’ research by the firm’s sharpest minds.
《麦肯锡季刊》(McKinsey Quarterly)已经50岁了。它选择来为自己庆生的，是一篇以该公司最敏锐的思想家多年研究为基础得出的重要文章。
As the resulting piece isn’t terribly snappy, here is a potted summary. The future, the consultants say, is going to be very big. Unfortunately, the past isn’t going to be a good guide to it. Or as they put it: “With more discontinuity and volatility and with long-term charts no longer looking like smooth upward curves, long-held assumptions giving way, and seemingly powerful business models becoming upended.”
由于文章本身并不十分生动有趣，我在这里作一个简短的概述。咨询顾问们表示，未来将是非常宏大的。遗憾的是，过去并不是未来的好指引。用这些顾问们的话说：“随着出现更多的不连续性和波动性、长期图表不再呈现为平滑上升的曲线，长期成立的假设将不再有效，看似强大的商业模式也将被颠覆。”
More specifically, three trends will shape this volatile, discontinuous, upended future. The first is technology. Its growth will be exponential and there will be “turbocharging advances in connectivity”. Second, growth in emerging markets will continue and a lot more big cities will spring up in places we’ve hardly heard of. Finally, all over the world everyone is going to go on getting older.
更具体地说，三个趋势将决定这一不稳定、不连续和被颠覆的未来。首先是技术。技术的发展将是指数型的，将“在连通性方面出现急速的进步”。其次，新兴市场将持续成长，将有比以前多得多的大城市在我们几乎从未听说过的地方涌现。最后，世界各地的人口都会日趋老龄化。
The banality of this is quite arresting. These aren’t trends of the future but of the present; if there is one thing that is true of the distant future it is that it tends not to be ruled by the same things that rule us now.
这种陈词滥调很引人注目。上面说的并不是什么未来的趋势，而是当下的趋势；如果说关于遥远的未来有一点肯定没错，那就是遥远的未来往往不受制于当下支配我们的那些事物。
But wait, there is more. These trends will have “extraordinary implications for global leaders”, it warns, before getting down to specifics: “It’s likely that different regions, countries, and individuals will have different fates, depending on the strength and flexibility of their institutions and policies.” I’d put it stronger than that. It is certain that some countries and people will do better than others, as it was always thus, and always will be.
但是请等等，还有更多呢。文章警告说，这些趋势会“对全球领导者产生异乎寻常的影响”；接下来，它详细解释道：“不同地区、国家和个人很可能会有不同的命运，具体取决于他们自身制度和政策的强度及灵活性。”我想用更强的语气来阐述下这点：“肯定”会有某些国家和人民过得比别人更好，过去一直如此，未来也将永远如此。
As for technology, McKinsey says it will shake up business “in unimaginable ways”. This has the advantage of being right. But it has the disadvantage of being a shameful cop-out as if you are forecasting it is your job to imagine those ways – and to tell us what they are.
至于技术，麦肯锡表示，它将以“难以想象的方式”撼动商业。这句话的优点在于它是对的。但它的缺点在于它逃避了应尽的责任：如果你要作预测，就该由你来想象这些方式，并告诉我们这些方式是什么。
The conclusion to all this? “Change is hard” – a declaration so crashingly obvious, it is odd that the authors feel the need to back it up with reference to “social scientists and behavioural economists” who have noticed a bias towards the status quo.
这一切的结论是什么？“改变是困难的”——文章宣布的这一结论简直是一个再明白不过的道理。奇怪的是，作者们觉得有必要援引那些已注意到事物发展倾向于维持现状的“社会学家和行为经济学家们”来支持这一结论。
There are various things that can be said about this sorry exercise in windy platitudes. First, 50 years is a ludicrously long time to try to forecast. Accountants, who are on the whole a more sensible lot than management consultants, typically don’t look out for more than a year when establishing if a business is a going concern. I sit on a board where we sometimes plan for the next five years – which is quite an enjoyable exercise, and it is useful to play with various things that might happen – but everyone always takes it with a handful of salt.
对于这种拙劣的陈词滥调，有几点可以说一下。首先，试图预测50年这么长的时间简直是一个笑话。总体而言比管理顾问更为理智的会计师，在判断一家企业能否持续经营时，一般不会关注一年以后的事。我是某家公司的董事会成员，我们董事会有时会规划未来五年的事——这是一种相当有趣的实践，而且琢磨一下各种可能情况是有价值的，但我们每个人都自始至终不敢全然相信这种规划。
Second, as my colleague Tim Harford recently pointed out, one of the reasons forecasts are so useless is that they aren’t forecasts at all. They are marketing exercises. Seen this way, the McKinsey piece starts to look a lot less boneheaded. “Tomorrow’s strategist must comprehend a world where offerings may vary?.?.?.?necessitating increasingly diverse approaches. All this will place a premium on agility: both to ‘zoom out’ in the development of a coherent global approach and to ‘zoom in’ on extremely granular product or market segments.” In other words, chief executives should get on the phone and appoint McKinsey at once.
其次，正如我同事蒂姆?哈福德(Tim Harford)最近指出的，说预测毫无价值的一个理由是，它们根本就不是什么预测。它们是营销活动。从这个角度看，麦肯锡这篇文章的愚蠢程度大大降低。“明日的战略家必须理解一个产品可能多种多样、因而应对之策必须日益多元化的世界。这一切使得敏锐性变得重要起来：既要在制定条理清晰的全球策略时做到‘高瞻远瞩’，也要在考察非常细分的产品或市场时做到‘细致入微’”。换句话说，首席执行官们应该立刻打电话委任麦肯锡作顾问。
My own forecast is rather different. Fifty years hence, McKinsey won’t exist. This is based on three trends similar to those the firm spotted. If economic activity moves to new and far-flung cities, these are the very parts of the world where western strategy consultants tend not to flourish.
我个人的预测则截然不同：50年后，麦肯锡将不会再存在。这个预测是依据三个趋势得出的，这三个趋势与麦肯锡点明的那些趋势类似。如果经济活动移向新的、遥远的城市，那么这些城市恰恰是西方战略咨询公司难以蓬勃发展的地方。
The next trend is that as executives get smarter in dealing with this complex world, they will be more able to solve their own problems. One of the reasons management consultants flourish is that chief executives look at their mediocre underlings and outsource work to brains on sticks instead. If the homegrown talent gets better, they will stop doing this.
下一个趋势是，随着企业高管在应对这个复杂的世界时变得更加聪明，他们将更有能力解决自己的问题。管理咨询公司能够蓬勃发展的原因之一是，首席执行官们看着他们平庸的下属，然后把工作外包给了一些书呆子。如果自家栽培的人才变得更优秀，他们就不会再这样做。
Most important is the effect of technology. All the grunt stuff consultants do analysing markets can be done by anyone with an internet connection. The two things that people will always be better at than machines are motivating others and coming up with original ideas. Yet on neither score does the consultant look good. Strategy firms don’t do much in the way of motivation. And as for originality, if the best McKinsey can do after years of study is say that technology, globalisation and ageing will feature in the next 50 years – a robot could have come up with that in a jiffy.
最重要的是技术的影响。咨询顾问在分析市场时所做的所有苦活累活，都可由任何一个能上互联网的人来完成。人永远比机器更擅长的两件事是，激励他人和想出有创意的点子。但咨询顾问在这两方面的表现看起来都不怎么样。战略公司不太采取激励他人的方式。至于创意，如果说经过多年的研究麦肯锡最多只能得出技术、全球化和人口老龄化将主导未来50年的结论，那么一个机器人能在片刻之间得出同样的东西。
Crude oil prices have plunged by $25, or more than 20 per cent, since mid-June, raising many questions. How low might prices go? If they rebound, at what level will they stabilise? Will Saudi Arabia and Opec move to cut output when they meet next month? At what price level might US shale oil production be affected and how severely?
自6月中旬以来，每桶原油的价格下跌了25美元，跌幅超过20%，这引发了许多问题。油价会跌到什么程度？如果油价出现反弹，它们会稳定在什么水平？沙特阿拉伯和欧佩克(OPEC)会在下个月会晤时削减产能么？油价在什么水平时，美国页岩油产量会受到影响，会受到多大影响？
One thing is certain: even the current lower prices are rapidly creating winners and losers. Losers are producers, countries and governments. If Brent falls to $80, Opec countries would lose some $200bn of their recent $1tn in earnings, affecting not only their ability to earn enough to cover the post-Arab Spring expanded budgets, but also their capacity to service debt without triggering defaults. And for the US, if prices fall much further, capital expenditures to expand production would have to be cut, potentially slowing the US shale revolution.
有一点是肯定的：即使是当前的较低油价，也在迅速催生赢家和输家。油价大跌的输家是石油生产国、各个国家和他们的政府。如果布伦特基准原油(Brent)价格指数跌至每桶80美元，欧佩克国家近期的一万亿美元盈利就会被抹去大约2000亿美元。这不仅会影响到他们的盈利能力，让他们无法实现阿拉伯之春(Arab Spring)后增加的预算，还会影响他们的偿债能力，让他们无法在不违约的情况下偿还所负债务的利息。此外，如果油价下跌过多，美国将被迫削减用于扩大产能的资本开支，这可能会延缓美国页岩气革命的进程。
On the other hand, the world economy as a whole would enjoy the equivalent of a huge quantitative easing programme, helping to spur sputtering economic growth. The decline in prices would generate a $1.8bn daily windfall, some $660bn annualised. Tracking this into gasoline prices, in the US, where last year some $2,900 per household was spent on gasoline, the windfall would amount to a tax rebate of just under $600 per household. It would affect all consumers globally save for those in Opec countries, who already pay little for fuel.
另一方面，油价大跌等价于一次超大规模量化宽松计划，它将有助于刺激磕磕绊绊的经济增长，全球经济总体会因此受益。每天，油价下跌会带来18亿美元的额外之财，这每年会产生大约6600亿美元的资金。让我们跟踪调查一下原油价格下跌对汽油价格的影响，在美国，去年每户人家用于汽油的费用约为2900美元，油价下跌带来的收益等价于每户不到600美元的税收折扣。这将对全球所有消费者产生影响——除了那些燃油开支本已极低的欧佩克国家消费者以外。
Prices have plummeted for several reasons: some of the decline is attributable to market sentiment, some to market fundamentals and, to a large measure, the geopolitical landscape. Brent crude has averaged around $110 per barrel since the Libyan disruption took 1m barrels per day off markets. Despite a Saudi production increase in 2011, $110 Brent was about $25 a barrel above traded prices just before the Libyan disruption. The main reason why Saudi Arabia could not damp prices was that the disrupted supply was light sweet crude, and refiners who needed it could not replace it with heavier, higher sulphur-content crude.
油价下跌有几个原因：部分原因要归结为市场情绪的影响，部分则是出于市场基本面的原因，还有很大一部分原因要归结为地缘政治格局的影响。自利比亚战乱令市场削减了100万桶原油产能之后，布伦特基准原油的价格平均为每桶110美元左右。尽管2011年沙特提升了原油产量，每桶110美元的布伦特原油价格还是比利比亚开战前高了大约25美元。沙特无法压低油价的主要原因是，受战乱影响的原油是轻质低硫原油，需要这类原油的炼油厂无法用密度较高、含硫量较大的原油取代它。
Meanwhile, two different trends have unfolded since 2011. The first has been the rise of domestic governance problems across oil exporters. Before February 2011, only some 400,000 b/d of oil was off-market because of disruption. Since then, disrupted supply has grown to more than 3.5m b/d at times, counting sanctioned Iranian oil and crude from Nigeria, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, to name a few, leading to geopolitical jitters.
与此同时，自2011年开始出现了两个截然不同的倾向。第一个倾向是石油出口国国内纷纷出现治理问题。2011年2月份以前，每天只有大约40万桶原油的产能受到战乱影响。在那之后，算上受制裁的伊朗的石油产能，以及产自尼日利亚、苏丹、叙利亚及也门等受制裁国家的原油，受战乱影响的产能时常攀升至每天350万桶的规模，这导致了地缘政治上的紧张局面。
The second trend is the tremendous growth of US oil output. Production is getting less costly every year and break-even costs are plummeting to much lower levels than commonly believed, certainly lower than $75 per barrel.
第二个倾向则是美国石油产量的巨大增长。石油生产的成本每年都在下降，盈亏平衡成本正大幅跌落至难以置信的水平，远低于每桶75美元。
One of the dilemmas for Opec stems from the division of interests of the sour, medium and heavy oil producers of the Gulf and the light crude producers in west and north Africa. The US supply surge is light and sweet and has created a glut of this kind of oil globally. No matter how much crude oil Saudi or the rest of Opec cuts, it will not correct the oversupply of light crude in the market.
对于欧佩克国家来说，其中一个困境源自两类国家之间的利益划分问题。一类是生产含硫轻油、中质原油和重质原油的海湾国家，另一类则是生产轻质原油的西方及北非国家。美国大幅增加的供应量是轻质低硫原油，这已导致全球这类原油供过于求。无论沙特和其他欧佩克国家削减多少原油产能，都无法消除轻质原油在市场中的供应过剩。
Yet other fundamentals are also at work. The global economy is weak and oil demand is rising at the puny rate of less than 1m b/d. Any projected increase in economic activity and demand for 2015 will probably leave an overall surplus of 1m b/d, which would weigh even more heavily on prices unless Opec cuts production. Political risk also appears more bearish than bullish, at least for the near term. An Iranian nuclear deal would mean more oil on the market, as would a continued surge in Libyan production.
不过，还有其他基本面因素在发挥作用。全球经济十分疲弱，石油需求的增长率每天还不到1百万桶。然而，任何一个对2015年经济活动和原油需求增长的预测给出的总体供应过剩可能都会在每天1百万桶以上。如果欧佩克不削减产能，这会对油价产生更大的下行压力。此外，至少在短期内，政治风险似乎仍是油价的利空因素而非利多因素。伊朗核能协议可能会导致更多石油投向市场，而利比亚产能继续激增也会产生同样效果。
Finally, price weakness has resulted in a host of conspiracy theories, based on Saudi Arabia having lowered the price of its oil for customers in Asia – price cuts now matched by Iran, Iraq and other Middle East producers. Statements by Saudi leaders indicate that they think US production growth would be hampered with oil prices much below $90, and it is already clear that with Brent at $90, a widening spread between Brent and WTI, the US benchmark, in 2015 could bring WTI below $75 a barrel. Additionally, lower prices would cost Iran and Russia dearly. Both countries are spending money in the Middle East in ways the kingdom does not like.
最后，价格疲软引发了一系列阴谋论。这些言论认为，沙特阿拉伯为了亚洲客户的利益压低了石油价格，而伊朗、伊拉克及其他中东石油生产国如今也在竞相压价。沙特领导人发表的声明指出，他们认为，大大低于90美元的石油价格会限制美国产量的增长。他们还认为，显而易见的是，当布伦特基准原油的价格为每桶90美元时，布伦特与美国基准原油西德克萨斯中质原油(WTI)之间的巨大差价会在2015年将WTI价格指数压低至每桶75美元以下。此外，较低的价格会为伊朗和俄罗斯带来巨大代价。这两个国家都在以沙特并不喜欢的方式向中东投入资金。
Are these rumours valid? Only time, and perhaps the Opec meeting in November, will tell. If prices continue to fall, US producers could prove to be a more resilient bunch than is commonly thought.
这些传闻是真的么？只有时间（或许还有11月份召开的欧佩克会议）能告诉我们这个问题的答案。如果油价继续下跌，事实可能会证明美国生产商的承受能力大大强于人们的预期。
BEIJING: A Chinese soldier who was stuck in India for over 50 years after he crossed over the border following the 1962 war today arrived here with his Indian family members to an emotional reunx with his Chinese kin.
北京:一个在1962年战争后穿越边境后滞留印度的中国士兵在今天随同他在印度的家人一同到达这里，和他在中国的亲戚激动团聚。
Wang Qi 77 was received by his close Chinese relatives besides officials of the China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Indian embassy when he arrived here along with his son daughter-in-law and grand daughter from Delhi-Beijing flight.
今年77岁的王琪与他的儿子儿媳孙女一同乘德里-北京的飞机到达后，受到他在中国的亲属的迎接，随同接机的有中国外交部和印度大使馆的官员。
Wang became emotional as he hugged his relatives their first reunx after he crossed into Indian side over five decades ago.
当他在五十年前跨越印度边界之后拥抱首次重聚的亲人时，情绪变得激动起来。
The ranks of immigrants and their children will grow to hit a record share of the US population in the second half of this century, new projections show, with Asian immigration taking over as the major source of population growth.
皮尤研究中心(Pew Research Center)一项新的预测显示，本世纪下半叶，外来移民及其子女在美国人口中的占比将升至创纪录水平，亚裔移民将接棒成为美国人口增长的主要来源。
The forecasts show the extent to which immigration will reshape the US population in the coming decades, even as politicians including Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump use hostility towards foreigners to appeal to significant parts of the electorate.
该预测显示出未来几十年移民将在多大程度上重塑美国人口格局，尽管包括共和党总统候选人唐纳德礠朗普(Donald Trump)在内的一些政客正通过敌视外国人来拉拢大量选民支持自己。
The report from the Pew Research Center finds that foreign-born individuals and their children will comprise no less than 36 per cent of the US population by 2065, higher than the peaks reached at the beginning of the 20th century and up from 26 per cent now. The ranks of foreign-born individuals alone will also rise to a record.
这份研究报告发现，到2065年时，海外出生的人及其子女将至少占美国人口的36%，不但比现在的26%要高，而且高于20世纪初达到的峰值。即使只考虑海外出生的人本身，其数量也将升至创纪录水平。
The research finds that the largest driver of US population growth over the next five decades will be immigration from Asian countries, with the expansion overtaking arrivals of Hispanics.
该研究发现，未来50年美国人口增长的最大驱动因素将是来自亚洲国家的移民，这一移民群体的扩张将超过拉美裔移民。
By 2065, Asians are projected to become the largest immigrant group, at 38 per cent of the immigrant population, surpassing Hispanics, at 31 per cent. Overall, the immigrant population will soar to 78m by 2065, compared with 45m today, with a growth rate double that of the US-born population.
到2065年时，预计亚裔将成为最大的移民群体，占全部移民人口的38%，而拉美裔占31%。总体来说，到2065年时美国的外来移民人口将飙升至7800万（现在为4500万），增长速度是美国境内出生人口增速的两倍。
The outlook comes as controversy over immigration plays a big role in the presidential election debate. Mr Trump’s attacks on Mexicans have raised fears among Republican strategists that the party will alienate Hispanic voters when they are becoming a powerful voice at the ballot box.
移民问题引发的争论如今正是美国总统大选辩论的重头戏。特朗普对墨西哥裔移民的抨击引起了共和党内战略家的担忧，他们担心在拉美裔选民成为投票箱前一支重要力量之际，共和党会疏远这些选民。
His words pander to a belief that illegal immigrants are still flooding into the US. Yet the ranks of unauthorised immigrants in the US stayed static between 2009 and 2014, Pew numbers showed, as illegal arrivals from Mexico slowed.
特朗普的言论迎合了某些人的一种看法，即非法移民仍在如潮水般涌入美国。然而皮尤的数据显示，2009年到2014年间，美国非法移民数量没有什么变化，而墨西哥裔非法移民的流入有所减缓。
“We are basing our trends on the patterns we have seen over the last 10 years,” said Jeffrey Passel, senior demographer at the research centre.
皮尤资深人口统计学家杰弗里帕塞尔(Jeffrey Passel)说：“我们是基于过去10年观察到的模式得出这一发展趋势的。”
Pew polling shows Americans deeply divided over benefits of further immigration, with 55 per cent of Democrats saying immigrants make US society better while 53 per cent of Republicans say immigrants make society worse.
皮尤的民调显示，对于进一步的移民流入是否有好处，美国人的看法存在严重分歧，55%的民主党人认为外来移民让美国社会变得更好，53%的共和党人认为让社会变得更糟。
The US population is expected to reach 441m by 2065, compared with 324m today, with 88 per cent of the increase linked to future immigrants and their descendants, says the report.
皮尤的报告显示，预计到2065年时美国人口将达4.41亿（现在为3.24亿），88%的人口增长与未来的移民及其后裔有关。
The Philippines' bachelor president, Benigno Aquino, confirmed Wednesday that he had put the fizz back into his love life by dating a South Korean media personality more than 20 years his junior.
菲律宾单身汉总统贝尼格诺?阿基诺本周三证实，正在与比自己小二十多岁的韩裔美女主播交往，自己的爱情生活中又加入了“汽水”。
"Well, we're seeing each other, OK?" the Filipino leader, who turns 52 next week, told reporters when asked about rumours swirling in the local press about him dating Grace Lee.
在记者追问地方媒体有关他与格蕾丝?李正在交往的传闻时，这位菲律宾总统说：“是的，我们正在约会，好吧？”他在下周将满52岁。
Lee, 29, who moved to the Philippines as a child, co-hosts a popular music radio programme in Manila as well as several television shows. She has nearly 60,000 followers on Twitter.
29岁的格蕾丝?李幼年时来到菲律宾，目前在马尼拉和他人共同主持一档电台流行音乐节目，另外还主持几档电视节目。她在推特上有近六万名粉丝。
Lee was also featured by the local edition of men's magazine FHM as one of its "100 Sexiest Women of the World" in 2010.
她还入选当地版的男性杂志FHM评选的2010年度“全球百位性感女郎”。
Confirmation that the balding, bespectacled president was dating again came after he said last year that the fizz had gone out of his love-life, describing it as going from "Coke regular" to "Coke zero".
阿基诺有些谢顶，还戴着眼镜，他证实两人正在交往。去年，他曾表示“汽水”已经远离了他的爱情生活，感叹自己的感情生活像可口可乐，从“普通可乐”变成了“零度可乐”。
Aquino said then that he was resigned to the idea of staying single until his term as president ended in mid-2016 because the demands of his job were too great.
阿基诺曾表示由于公务繁忙，在2016年中任期届满之间将保持单身，但他现在已经转变了想法。
Nevertheless, one of his sisters told the local media in late 2010 that he had dated at least three other younger women, including his personal stylist, in the hectic period after he was elected to the presidency in May that year.
但他的一位姐妹在2010年末曾告诉当地媒体，他至少曾与另外三位年轻女子交往过，包括他的个人设计师。阿基诺于2010年5月当选总统，当时正处于兴奋期。
Aquino, who generally bristles at the intense media interest in his personal life, declined to provide further details of his romance with Lee.
阿基诺常对媒体对他私生活的刨根问底感到恼怒。此次他也拒绝提供两人恋情的更多细节。
Even at 55, Madonna’s still got it! The superstar posted yet another photo of her fit physique on her Instagram account on Wednesday showing off she is just as flexible as her Danceteria days.
美国流行乐坛天后麦当娜55岁不服老，星期三在图片分享应用Instagram上上传一张在健身中心的劈叉照片，展示自己的柔韧性不减当年。
Posing in black workout wear, Madonna told fans: ‘Today I made like a banana and split! #flexible #hardcandyfitness’. Displaying her pert derriere front and centre in the photo, it’s no surprise to find that Madonna’s favourite part of the body to exercise is her butt.
照片中麦当娜身着黑色练功服，轻松摆出一字马造型，豪放地展示了自己的臀部，可想而知这是她最引以为傲的锻炼成果。她还给粉丝留言：“今天成功劈叉，姿势完爆香蕉皮。”
Madonna is known for her strict macrobiotic diet and intense fitness regime, working out at least six days a week, to maintain her bod for her energetic live performances.
麦当娜的养生食谱和健身计划可谓惨绝人寰，每星期至少要练功六天，确保现场表演活力昂扬。
The mother of four shows no signs of slowing down either, telling the media in January: ‘I'm not going to slow down, get off this ride, stay home and get fat!’ ‘There is no easy way. If you want to know how I look like I do, it's diet and exercise and constantly being careful.’ Madge went on to admit.
麦当娜已经是四个孩子的母亲了，在连功上却没有松懈分毫。今年一月份，她对媒体说：“我不会停止练功，懈怠地呆在家里，把自己养成一个胖子！”接下来她向媒体坦白了自己保持身材的秘诀：“所有事都不可能有捷径，如果你们想知道我是怎样保持身材的，我能告诉你们的就是节食、锻炼、时刻保持警惕。
The photo of Madge doing the splits is the latest image of the superstar showing off her enviable figure and fitness levels to promote her gym, Hard Candy Fitness.
麦当娜晒劈叉照片一方面是展示自己令人艳羡的身材和柔韧性，另一方面也是为了宣传她在多伦多开设健身中心“硬糖健身中心”。
Last week the pop icon shared another photo, taken at her latest gym opening in Toronto.
上星期，这位流行巨星又分享了另外一张照片，也是拍摄于多伦多的“硬糖健身中心”。
Madonna wrote: ‘Check out my dance workout from Toronto HC gym opening!’ She added: ‘I dare you to watch and not sweat! @hardcandyfitness #gohardorgohome’
麦当娜还在社交网络上写道：“多伦多HC健身中心开张时，我会为大家献舞哦！”并且艾特了她的健身中心。
Ving Rhames thinks Tom Cruise is getting too old to do his own stunts.
文?瑞姆斯认为汤姆?克鲁斯年纪大了，不能再做危险动作了。
The 59-year-old actor stars opposite Tom, 56, in the Mission: Impossible series and after Tom broke his ankle shooting a scene where he stumbled after jumping onto a building for the latest movie in the series, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, he thinks it's time he left the tougher challenges to stunt professionals.
这位59岁的男演员，在《碟中谍》系列电影中与56岁的阿汤哥上演对手戏。在这一系列最新的一部：《碟中谍6：全面瓦解》中，在一幕跳上楼顶的拍摄中，阿汤哥绊倒并且扭伤了脚踝。瑞姆斯觉得，是时候把高挑战动作交给特技专业演员了。
'I was in Los Angeles, getting ready to go to London. I'm sorry he got injured, but Tom's getting older now,' he told Empire magazine. 'I know he loves doing his own stunts, but as a friend, maybe we should let the stunt guy do it. '
“我当时在洛杉矶，正准备去伦敦。他受伤了我很难过，但阿汤哥确实是老了”，他对《帝国杂志》这样说到，“我知道他爱亲力亲为，但是作为朋友，也许我们应该让专业人士来做这些。”
Simon Pegg was on a break from filming when the accident happened. He said: 'I'd taken a break from production. I went off to do Slaughterhouse Rulez, my assistant phoned me and said, "I think Tom has hurt himself." So my week-long hiatus turned into three months.
事故发生时，西蒙?佩吉也正在休假。他说：“我当时正从《碟中谍》暂时抽了个身，投入到《屠宰场规则》的拍摄。我的助手给我打电话说汤姆好像把自己弄伤了。于是我一周长的假期变成了三个月。”
But another star of the film, Vanessa Kirby, was stunned by how quickly Tom bounced back and threw himself back into work. She said: 'I wasn't on set that day. It was a Sunday. I was told, "There's been an accident so I'm not sure filming is going to go ahead tomorrow." Suddenly it was three months later. Within a few months, Tom was back running and doing loads of things I couldn't do.'
这部电影另一位演员，凡妮莎?柯比则对迅速恢复、再次投入工作的阿汤哥惊叹不已。她说：“那天我不在片场，是个星期天。我随后被告知：出了点意外，暂时还不能确定明天是否照常拍摄。一眨眼三个月了，然而短短几个月，汤姆就生龙活虎地回归了，许多我做不到的事对他来说也不是难事。”
The film has been a massive success. The domestic total as of Friday was $173m. And the worldwide gross is $493m.
这部电影取得了巨大成功。截至上周五，国内总票房达1.73亿美元，全球总票房达4.93亿美元。
New York-listed 58.com and a second Chinese online marketplace have agreed to merge, as consolidation acc-elerates in the local technology sector.
在中国科技行业加速整合的大背景下，在纽约上市的58同城和中国另一家在线市集已同意合并。
A memorandum of understanding between 58.com and Ganji.com, which both function much like US site Craigslist, was signed in Beijing on March 14, people familiar with the matter said. The two groups are expected to announce as soon as today that they are planning to combine to create what will become one of the largest specialised online classified companies in China’s booming mobile internet space. The combined group could be valued at as much as $10bn, one person involved in the transaction said.
知情人士表示，3月14日，58同城(58.com)和赶集网(Ganji.com)在北京签署了一份谅解备忘录，两家网站的功能很像美国的分类广告网站Craigslist。预计这两家公司将最早于今日宣布，双方正计划合并，以在中国蓬勃发展的移动互联网市场缔造最大专业在线分类广告公司之一。据参与交易的一位人士称，合并后公司的估值最高可能达到100亿美元。
Because of antitrust concerns the transaction will probably involve two stages. Currently 58.com, which declined to comment, is about twice as big as Ganji.com, but both companies provide a range of online advertising listings including job adverts, housing and second-hand goods. Last year, internet group Tencent bought a 20 per cent stake in 58.com, and the online marketplace announced last month it had acquired Shanghai-based property-listing platform Anjuke Inc for about $267m in cash and shares.
由于反垄断担忧，这笔交易可能会分成两个阶段。58同城拒绝置评。目前，58同城的市值是赶集网的两倍左右，但两家公司都提供一系列在线广告列表，包括招聘广告、住房和二手商品。去年，互联网集团腾讯(Tencent)购入58同城20%股权，而58同城上月宣布，已通过大约2.67亿美元的现金加股票交易，收购总部位于上海的房地产租售信息平台安居客(Anjuke Inc)。
Haoyong Yang, founder of Ganji.com, will become one of the co-chief executives along with Jinbo Yao, founder of 58.com, the person said.
上述知情人士称，赶集网创始人杨浩涌将与58同城创始人姚劲波担任合并后新公司的联合首席执行官。
The latest merger comes at a time when investors are bullish about Chinese internet shares. “People are fighting over the market,” said one leading tech investor.
这一最新并购交易出炉之际，正值投资者看涨中国互联网股票。一位领先的科技投资者表示：“人们正为这个市场展开争夺。”
The happy couple, one a British royal and the other a commoner. A much-anticipated May wedding.
一对幸福的夫妇，一方是英国王室成员，另一方是平民。一场备受期待的五月婚礼。
But this is not Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It was Princess Margaret, the sister of Queen Elizabeth II, and Antony Armstrong-Jones, a photographer, who were married on May 6, 1960.
但这指的不是哈里王子和梅根·马克尔(Meghan Markle)。而是女王伊丽莎白二世(Elizabeth II)的妹妹玛格丽特公主(Princess Margaret)和摄影师安东尼·阿姆斯特朗·琼斯(Antony Armstrong-Jones)，两人于1960年5月6日举行了婚礼。
Then as now, there was heightened interest across the Atlantic, and The Times had a front-page photo and story.
那时和现在一样，大西洋两岸的人们兴趣高昂，《纽约时报》在头版刊登了婚礼的照片和报道。
Here’s how we covered the day:
这是我们对那天的报道:
We wrote about the crowds who waited to see the couple on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.
我们写了等待这对夫妇出现在白金汉宫阳台上的人群。
There were tales of royal weddings that did not go smoothly and gifts from afar.
有关于过去王室婚礼进行得不顺利的报道，以及来自远方的礼物。
More than a dozen short items covered the details of the day, including tiara trouble and a bomb scare.
十几篇简短的报道涵盖了那一天的细节，包括冠饰的麻烦和炸弹惊吓。
We had drawings of the guests and the clothes, including a going-away hat shaped “like a soufflé.”
我们有描绘宾客和服饰的画像，其中包括一顶“像蛋奶酥”的蜜月帽子。
And, finally, a television piece marveled at the BBC’s coverage and noted, “Thanks to videotape and jet airplanes, pictures of live quality were shown on North American screens only six to seven hours after the event had occurred in London.”
最后，还有一篇电视方面的内容，对BBC的报道感到惊讶，并指出：“多亏了录像带和喷气式飞机，伦敦这场事件发生后仅仅六到七个小时，北美的屏幕上就出现了高质量的现场画面。”
The couple split after 16 years.
这对夫妇在16年后分开了。
The fifth-generation cellular network rolling out in America and other countries this year will revolutionize the way our devices connect to the internet and to one another.
今年在美国和其他国家铺开的5G网络将彻底改革我们的设备连接互联网以及彼此互联的方式。
5G is such a technologically important leap forward–without it the future smart cities we dream about where everything is connected simply wouldn’t be possible.
5G网络从技术层面上取得了重大的飞跃，没有这项技术，我们梦想中万物互联的未来智能城市不可能实现。
However, there is one major–and unavoidable–drawback to 5G: It’s going to cost you your location privacy.
然而，5G网络有一个不可避免的重大缺陷：那就是你的位置将不再是隐私。
Anyone with access to your ISP’s cell tower data will be able to hone in on your exact location far more precisely than they can today under our 4G networks.
任何可以访问你的互联网服务供应商（ISP）手机基站数据的人都可以锁定你的确切位置，这比我们目前的4G网络提供的信息更加准确。
The reason for this is that 4G network technology has a wide coverage area when it comes to being broadcast from a single cellular tower.
造成这种结果的原因是通过单一基站的传播，4G网络技术的覆盖区域很广。
Matter of fact, 4G can be broadcast about a mile from a single tower.
实际上，通过单一基站，4G网络可以传播的距离约1英里。
5G network technology, on the other hand, has a much smaller coverage area, and it can’t penetrate through walls to get indoors as well as 4G technology can.
然而，5G网络技术的覆盖范围要小得多，它无法像4G网络技术那样穿墙入室。
This means 5G networks will require many more cellular towers placed closer together.
这意味着5G网络需要更多距离更近的基站。
These towers won’t be like the old towers you envision that look like electrified Eiffel Towers, mind you, they’re just small antennas that will need to be dotted around on rooftops and street lights and inside shopping malls and other buildings.
这些基站不会像你想象中宛如电气化的埃菲尔铁塔那样的老式塔楼，提醒你一下，它们只是那些需要安置于屋顶上、路灯上、购物商场里以及其他建筑物上的小天线。
Since 5G towers will need to be everywhere and you’ll only connect to one 5G tower at a time, your mobile network will now be able to pinpoint your location much more accurately–even knowing which building you are in.
因为5G网络基站需要安置在各处，而且你每次只能连接1个5G基站，所以你的手机网络如今能够更加准确地定位你的位置，甚至知道你在哪栋建筑物里。
Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia said on Wednesday that they had indicted five people, including two research scientists, on charges of stealing trade secrets about drugs to treat cancer and other diseases from GlaxoSmithKline, the British drug giant.
费城联邦检察官周三表示，他们已起诉五人从英国制药巨头葛兰素史克公司(GlaxoSmithKline)窃取商业秘密。这些商业秘密涉及治疗癌症和其他疾病的药物。其中两人是药物研究科学家。
According to prosecutors, the two scientists, Yu Xue and Lucy Xi, worked at Glaxo’s research facility in Upper Merion, Pa., and emailed and downloaded confidential data about a dozen or more company products to associates who planned to sell and market the trade secrets through a company they set up in China, called Renopharma.
检方表示，这两名科学家薛羽（音）和露西·席(Lucy Xi)在葛兰素史克位于宾夕法尼亚州上梅仁(Upper Merion)的研究机构工作。她们下载了该公司十几个或更多产品的机密数据，并通过电邮发送给同案犯。后者谋划通过自己设在中国的任诺药业(Renopharma)，出售和推广这些商业秘密。
Some of the documents involved a monoclonal antibody, a type of cancer treatment, that the company was developing. The indictment, unsealed on Wednesday, describes Ms. Xue, 45, as “one of the top protein biochemists in the world,” who was the co-leader of the company’s project to develop the drug.
其中一些资料涉及葛兰素史克公司正在研制的抗癌药物单克隆抗体。周三公布的起诉书称，45岁的薛羽是“全球最顶尖的蛋白质生物化学家之一”。她也是该公司研发这种药物的联合领导者。
Federal prosecutors with the Eastern District of Pennsylvania said that to conceal their crime, Ms. Xue and two other associates, Tao Li and Yan Mei, agreed to put the proceeds in the name of Ms. Xue’s sister, Tian Xue, who was also charged. Ms. Xi worked with Ms. Xue at Glaxo and was married to Mr. Mei, prosecutors said.
宾夕法尼亚东区的联邦检察官表示，为了掩盖罪行，薛羽和另外两个同伙李涛（音）、梅岩（音）决定将收益转到薛羽的姐妹薛天（音）名下，薛天也在本案中遭到指控。露西·席是薛羽在葛兰素史克的同事，也是梅岩的妻子，检察官说。
The indictment quotes emails among some of the people charged in the indictment, and accuses them of plotting to seek investors in China to market their own products from stolen research.
起诉书援引了嫌疑人之间的一些电子邮件，指控他们谋划在中国寻找投资者，推广他们根据窃取的研究成果自制的产品。
In a statement, the company said it had been cooperating with federal authorities and “we do not believe the breach has had any material impact” on the company’s business or research and development activity.
葛兰素史克在一份声明中表示，公司已经在与联邦当局开展合作，“我们认为，这起泄密事情并未对公司的经营或研发工作造成重大影响”。
Lawyers for the defendants could not be reached immediately for comment.
记者无法立即联系到被告律师请求置评。
BBC News – Five Dallas police officers have been killed and six wounded by gunmen during protests against the shooting of black men by police, authorities say. Three people are in custody and one man who was in a stand-off with police shot himself dead, US media have reported.
BBC新闻 – 当局说，警方枪杀黑人遭到抗议期间，5名达拉斯警员被枪手射杀，6名警员受伤。3人被羁押，一名与警方对峙的男子饮弹自尽，美国媒体报道说。
Gunfire broke out at around 20:45 local time on Thursday as demonstrators marched through the city. The protests came after this week's deaths of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana.
枪战于周四当地时间约20:45爆发，当时示威者穿城游行。抗议活动的起因，是本周明尼苏达的费兰多.卡斯蒂尔和路易斯安那的埃尔顿.斯特林之死。
The Dallas attack marks the deadliest day for US law enforcement officers since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. President Barack Obama, who is visiting Poland, said it was a "vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement".
达拉斯枪袭标志着这一天成为自2001年911袭击以来美国执法机关伤亡最惨重的一天。正在波兰访问的奥巴马总统说，枪袭是“对执法机关恶毒，蓄意和卑鄙的袭击”。
Dallas Police Chief David Brown said the suspects were all believed to have been working together, using rifles to carry out attacks while the protest rally was drawing to a close. Two snipers had fired from "elevated positions", shooting some officers in the back.
达拉斯警长布朗说，嫌犯据信都是团伙作案，当抗议集会接近尾声时使用步枪发动袭击。两名狙击手从“高处”开枪，射中一些警员的背部。
"We believe that these suspects were positioning themselves in a way to triangulate on these officers from two different perches... and planned to injure and kill as many law enforcement officers as they could," Chief Brown said.
“我们认为，这些嫌犯采取从两个不同高点对这些警员作三角定位的站位方式……计划尽可能多地射死射伤执法人员。”
Officers later surrounded a car park near El Centro College, as an armed man fired off rounds with a rifle. Chief Brown said the suspect had told negotiators that "the end is coming" and that he was going to attack more officers and had "bombs all over the place". US media say the man is now dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and the stand-off is over.
警员后来包围了埃尔森特罗学院附近的一个停车场，其间，一名武装男子用步枪多次开火。布朗警长说，嫌犯对谈判人员说，“末日快到了”， 他要袭击更多警员，“到处放满炸弹”。美国媒体说，这名男子现已开枪自杀，对峙结束。
Chief Brown said earlier: "We do not have a comfort level that we have all the suspects." He said that 11 officers had been shot "ambush style" by sniper fire.
布朗警长早些时候说：“我们还没有到抓获所有嫌犯的安心程度。”他说，11名警员遭到狙击火力“伏击方式”的袭击。
One of those killed was Brent Thompson, 43, a transport police officer with the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). He is the first DART officer to be killed in the line of duty.
中弹身亡者之一是达拉斯捷运43岁的交通警察布兰特.汤普森。他是首位因公殉职的捷运警员。
Amateur video footage showed one police officer approaching a gunman and taking cover behind a concrete pillar. The gunman shoots the officer at least twice, leaving him motionless, and then flees.
路人拍摄的视频显示，一名警员向枪手靠近，以水泥柱作掩护。枪手向这名警员至少开枪两次，使他不再动弹后逃之夭夭。
Most of us have at least one friend we consider toxic: the loser friend who disrupts our entire world the second they step into it. We know things would be so much easier if we cut them loose, yet we spend more time figuring out why we stay than it would take to actually leave.
大多数人都至少有一个浑身散发负能量的“有毒”的朋友：只要他们前脚踏足，我们的世界马上变得乱七八糟。我们都知道远离这样的朋友，事情会变得更加简单，其实我们已经花了太多时间去思考为什么还要留在这样的朋友身边。
Why You Have Loser Friends
为什么你有负能量的朋友
The truth is, it happens for a multitude of reasons:
实际上，有很多原因：
You’ve been friends with them since you were kids.
你们是发小。
You know them so well you’re constantly justifying their behavior.
太了解他们了，所以经常评判他们的行为。
You feel guilty because they don’t have anyone else to turn to.
他们没有其他可以求助的对象，所以你会有负罪感。
You feel obligated to spend time with them because they’re a mutual friend of your BFF/spouse/family member.
他们也是你男朋友/配偶/家庭成员，所以你觉得有责任要陪着他们。
You’re afraid of how they’ll react if you confront them (a.k.a. more drama).
如果你跟他们正面遭遇，你很怕他们会有的反应（会更戏剧化）。
You feel it’s easier to deal with them than disrupt your lifestyle any further.
与其破坏现有的生活方式，还不如和他们继续相处下去。
Usually though, it’s a simple case of outgrowing each other. What caused you to “click” initially as friends no longer applies, or your lives are going in completely different directions.
通常情况下，这只是简单的两个人不搭的问题而已。当初让你觉得是朋友的冲动不复存在，或者是你俩的生活方向截然不同。
What Constitutes a Loser Friend?
到底负能量朋友的标志是什么？
When I use the term “loser friend,” I don’t mean they themselves are losers—everyone is entitled to live their life exactly how they want to—but what they’re doing to your life is causing you to lose what you want… and you’re letting it happen.
我用的短语是“负能量朋友”，我的意思并不是他们本身就是负能量的，毕竟每个人都有权利去照着自己的想法来生活，但如果他们给你生活造成的影响使你失去了你想要的东西，你就需要注意了。
If you have friends who do any of the following, you need to seriously consider their place in your life:
如果你有朋友干以下这些事情，你需要认真的考虑考虑他们在你生活中的地位了。
They’re not supportive.
他们帮不上忙。
They’re not there when you need them.
你需要他们的时候总是不在。
They’re only there when they need you.
只有在需要你的时候他们才会出现。
They make you feel drained.
他们让你觉得累。
They have no ambition.
他们没有野心。
They constantly infuriate you.
他们经常激怒你。
They expect you to drop everything when they want to do something.
当他们想干什么的时候，他们希望你能抛下一切。
They think everything is an urgent crisis.
他们觉得每件事都是急事。
Take it from someone who watched her own life implode: if you want to be amazing, you have to spend your time with amazing people. In order to make room for these people, you have to leave your loser friends behind.
从那些内心充满激情的人中学习学习吧：如果你想变得厉害，你必须花时间和那些厉害的人在一起。为了空出时间给这些人，还是抛下负能量的朋友们吧。
Why You Should Leave Your Loser Friends Behind
为什么要远离负能量的朋友
It’s not going to be easy, but letting them go is a necessary part of creating the life you’ve always wanted for yourself. Otherwise:
这也不是那么简单的一件事，但是想要过上自己想要的生活，远离他们是必须的，否则：
1. They’ll hold you back from your full potential.
他们会耗光你所有的潜能
The biggest thing I learned from my experience with friends like these is that you’ll never live up to your full potential if you’re constantly weighed down by unnecessary drama and complication. In order to succeed, you need a solid routine and a strong support system. Consider your loser friends the loose floorboard in that support system, constantly distracting you from your goals.
我个人对于这类朋友最大的经验就是，如果你长期被他们不必要的戏剧化和复杂性干扰，你永远无法发挥自己最大的潜能。要想成功，你需要一个坚定的路线和强大的支持体系。把那些负能量朋友踢出你的后备军团吧，他们能做的只是干扰你罢了。
2. They’ll make you feel like crap about yourself.
他们会让你觉得很糟糕
When they want you to do something you don’t want to do, they’ll constantly nag you and make you feel guilty about being who you are until you cave to their demands. It’s an incessant, vicious cycle that won’t end until you put a stop to it. If you don’t, get ready for a wide array of self-esteem issues.
如果他们想你去做你不愿意做的事情，他们会一直缠着你，让你有负罪感，觉得你应该满足他们的需求。这样一来就会形成恶性循环，无休无止。但如果不远离，你就做好各类打击自信的心理准备吧。
3. They’ll negatively impact your reputation.
他们会对你的名声产生负面影响
You were guilted into going to that party and became your sloppy friend’s crutch, and the dream employer you’ve wanted to work with since you were in public school is going to know that when they’re checking out the horrific pictures you’re tagged in on Facebook.
你被朋友说服陪TA去参加聚会（不去你会觉得很内疚），成为你懒散朋友的拐杖。你从上公立学校开始就一直梦想为其工作的理想雇主，早就在脸书里看过你那些恐怖的照片了，而你却对此一无所知。
More than that, if you’re this easily influenced in your personal life, they’re going to assume you won’t be able to hack it in a professional setting.
不仅如此，如果这个轻而易举的就影响到你的个人生活，他们就会觉得你无法在专业的环境中应对自如。
4. They’ll bring out the worst in you.
他们会让你不自觉展示最差的那一面
You know all of those bad habits you’re trying to break? Your loser friends will make it so difficult for you to build good habits you’ll constantly crack under the pressure and eventually give up on the concept entirely. After all, if you change for the better, your relationship with them will change for the worse, and will work against what they need from you.
你想试图改掉那些坏习惯？这些负能量朋友会让你举步维艰，你无法养成好的习惯，在重压之下你最终就会放弃。毕竟，如果你变得更好，你和他们的关系就会变得更差，这会妨碍到他们利用你。
5. They’ll dim the good things in your life.
他们会毁了你生活中的美好事物
You’ll be so focused on their drama, needs, and wants, the stress of your friendship will cause you to lose focus on the aspects of your life that are going well. Simply put, negativity breeds negativity—is this really how you want your life to be?
你总是关注他们的戏剧化生活、需要和想法，这种友情的压力会让你无法关注自己正在变好的生活。简单的说，消极带来消极——你难道真希望生活变成这样么？
So what are you waiting for? Leave drama to the circus and live your life exactly how you want to, with who you want to. If you don’t decide to do so now, your loser friends will decide for you.
你还在等什么呢？把这类人撇除自己的生活圈，好好的和那些你愿意在一起的朋友们过上自己想过的生活。如果你现在还不做决定，那些负能量朋友就会左右你。
A 5-year-old girl recently fell from the 11th floor of a residential building in Chengdu, Sichuan province.
近日，四川省成都市一名5岁女童从一栋居民楼的11楼坠下。
At about 8:30 p.m. on the evening of Sept. 5, many residents of the Jinjiang City Park residential complex were gathered in the courtyard of Building No. 4.
9月5日晚上8点半左右，锦江城市花园小区4号楼下围着不少住户。
About 20 minutes prior, a young girl had fallen from above and landed in a patch of grass.
大约20分钟前，一个小女孩从11楼坠落，掉入一楼绿化带内。
One resident, who was in a teahouse on the first floor at the time of the incident, heard a loud sound. He ran out and quickly spotted the girl.
事件发生时，一位居民当时正在一楼的茶馆，并听到一声巨响。随后他赶快跑出去，并发现了这名小女孩。
"She wasn't bleeding or crying. She just blinked her eyes," the resident recalled.
这位居民回忆道："她没有流血，也没有哭，就在那里眨巴眼睛。"
According to another witness, she attempted to stand up, but bystanders stopped her.
据另一位目击者表示，小女孩还想要站起来，但旁观者阻止了她。
A reporter from Chengdu Commercial Daily noticed that there were several broken tree branches around the area where the girl landed; some of the branches were as thick as two fingers.
《成都商报》一位记者注意到，小女孩坠落的地方有一些被压断的树枝，其中一些约有两个手指粗。
"The branches were fractured by the girl's fall," explained a witness.
一目击者解释道："树枝是她落下来的时候砸断的。"
Another witness recalled, "She actually talked to us. 'I am from the 11th floor' is what she said."
另一位目击者回忆道："小女孩还能说话，她当时说，'我是11楼的。'"
The girl's father told the reporter that he was on a business trip at the time of the accident, and that his wife had briefly left the girl home alone so she could take their son to school.
女孩的爸爸告诉记者，事发时自己在外地出差，妈妈送儿子上学去了，将女儿一人留在家里。
While her mother was gone, the girl climbed through the window and fell to the ground.
妈妈离开后，小女孩爬上窗户，然后摔了下来。
"I guess she heard the sound of other children playing downstairs," said the girl's father. "We are very grateful to our neighbors and the staff of the property management company."
女孩的爸爸表示："我猜她是听到了楼下孩子们玩耍的声音。我们非常感谢小区的邻居和物业员工们的帮助。"
The number of China's single men could exceed the entire population of Australia in five years' time, a Fujian government statistician has calculated.
一名福建政府统计人员估计，五年之内，中国单身男性数量将会超过整个澳大利亚人口。
There are likely to be 118.9 boys born for every 100 girls by 2020, Yao Meixiong, deputy director of census with the Fujian Provincial Bureau of Statistics, told The Paper website.
福建省统计局（Fujian Provincial Bureau of Statistics）普查中心副主任姚美雄接受澎湃新闻（The Paper）网采访表示，预计到2020年，出生人口性别比（即出生100个女婴对应出生的男婴数）为118.9。
That would result in an extra 9.5 million men aged from 20 to 29, 12.6 million boys under 9-years-old and millions more in the ages in between. Australia's population is about 24 million.
这意味着，20—29岁的男性将比女性多出950万；9岁以下男孩比女孩多1260万；而9-20岁的男性会比女性多出几百万。而澳大利亚的人口为2400万。
At least 10 per cent of the nation's young men would not be able to find a spouse after 2020, Yao claimed, adding that the greatest imbalance would be among the youngest generation, meaning younger men would find it harder to find a partner.
姚美雄认为，2020年以后，一成以上年轻男性将找不到配偶，此外，越年轻的一代，男女比例失衡情况越严重，也就是说，越年轻的男性越难找到伴侣。
He suggested this could lead to a new social group of single men being formed, most of whom would be poor and likely to remain single for the rest of their lives.
他表示，社会由此将形成一个新的单身男性社会群体，他们大多数为贫穷男性，并且可能终生“打光棍”。
A census report of Xiamen city in Fujian found there were 111.69 men to every 100 women in 2000 but the imbalance has been worse – in 2010 it was 118.37 to 100.
福建省厦门市的一份人口普查报告显示，该市2000年出生人口性别比为111.69，2010年为118.37，性别比例失衡的情况更严重了。
The ratio was 108.47 in 1982, 115 in 1994 and 121.2 in 2004, according to government figures.
根据政府数据，该数字1982年为108.47，1994年为115，2004年为121.2。
Experts put the differences down to the one-child policy, gender selection procedures and a deeply rooted preference for boys over girls in Chinese families.
专家将此失衡归咎于“独生子女”政策、胎儿性别鉴定以及中国家庭根深蒂固的“重男轻女”观念。
Anhui, Hainan and Fujian provinces had the worst gender imbalances, said Wang Huirong, a Xiamen health department official.
厦门市卫计委工作负责人王辉荣表示，安徽、海南和福建性别比例失调最为严重。

China’s producer price growth moderated further in May to the equal-lowest level since December as consumer prices continued to pick up.
5月，中国生产者价格增速继续降低，降至与去年12月相等且为12月以来的最低水平，而消费价格持续升高。
The producer price index published by China’s National Bureau of Statistics recorded a year-on-year rise of 5.5 per cent in May, though that fell short of a median forecast of 5.7 per cent from economists polled by Reuters.
中国国家统计局(CNB)数据显示，5月中国生产者价格指数(PPI)同比上涨5.5%，不过，这个数字低于路透(Reuters)对经济学家调查得出的增幅预测中值5.7%。
Consumer inflation accelerated for a third straight month in May, recording a rise of 1.5 per cent compared to a year ago, dead-on economist expectations of 1.1 per cent growth.
5月，中国消费价格指数（CPI）连续第3个月上涨，同比涨幅达1.5%，非常接近经济学家们的预测涨幅1.1%。
A stunning equity rally and a series of easing steps from the central bank has done little to embolden Chinese consumers.
A股涨幅惊人，中国央行也祭出一系列宽松措施，但这些都没能帮中国消费者壮胆。
The Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator held steady this month at 111.1, after falling from 114.7 in March. The level is below the 12-month average of 112.4.
本月，澳大利亚西太研究所中国消费者信心指数(Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator)维持在111.1，低于3月的114.7。本月读数低于112.4的12个月平均值。
With the economy in a broad slowdown, perhaps this shouldn't be surprising. "Consumer confidence has declined throughout much of the last year along with deterioration in the economy," MNI says.
随着经济整体放缓，或许对于这一读数的低迷并不应感到意外。国际市场新闻社(MNI)表示：“由于经济形势的恶化，去年大部分时间里消费者信心一直在下滑。”
But Beijing played a key role in propelling the stock market higher in the last year, likely in an effort to create a "wealth effect" and help aid the economy.
但北京方面在去年推动股市上涨方面发挥了关键的作用，很可能是为了制造“财富效应”，并为帮助支撑经济发展。
Details of the report bear out some success on this front: lower income households, who are less likely to be involved in the equity market, reported a 3.1 per cent decline in confidence, but higher income households reported a 2.8 per cent increase.
报告的细节证明了这方面的部分成功：低收入家庭（不大可能投资股市）的信心指数下降了3.1%，但高收入家庭的信心指数则升高了2.8%。
Plus, a record 7.8 per cent of consumers said that local shares "were the wisest place to keep their savings." (The worrying aspect of that line can be dealt with later).
另外，有7.8%的消费者表示，国内股票“是他们配置存款的最明智渠道。”这一比例是创纪录的。
But where's the ripple effect? Consumers "turned less optimistic about future business conditions," the survey noted, and the component tracking the one-year outlook is now "back to the level recorded before the authorities began cutting interest rates in November."
但连锁反应体现在哪里？调查指出，消费者“对未来商业状况更不乐观了，”现在追踪一年展望的指数“回到了当局去年11月降息之前的水平。”
Current conditions and the five-year outlook also registered declines, while confidence among people aged between 55 and 64 even hit a record low. (Everyone between 18 and 54 was feeling better, however).
当前状况和五年展望的信心指数也在下降，55岁至64岁之间人群的信心指数甚至下降到创纪录的低点。（然而，18岁至54岁人群的信心更强。）
In short, the stock market might be up but it's the broader economy weighing on the minds of ordinary people. Efforts from the People's Bank of China have helped to stabilise sentiment, but that might be it.
简言之，股市或许会上涨，但对普通民众影响更大的是宏观经济。中国央行(PBoC)的努力对稳定信心有帮助，但那也只是一种可能性。
You had a tough 2014. In September, you left Pimco, the investment firm you founded in 1971, where you became known as “the bond king.” What was the hardest part about the past year for you? The fact that I was fired. That was hard — very hard — for me, because I’m sensitive. I’m just sensitive to negative criticism — which I think was unfair and unjust. You haven’t been divorced yet, have you?
你的2014有些艰难。9月，你离开了太平洋投资管理公司(Pimco)，也就是你在1971年创办的投资公司，你在那里成了众所周知的“债券之王”。对你而言，过去一年中最艰难的事情是什么？就是我被解雇一事。因为我很敏感，所以这对我来说很艰难——非常艰难。我就是对负面批评很敏感，我认为那都是不公平公正的。你目前还没离过婚，对吧？
Nope. I’m happily married. Sorry, the “yet” was not appropriate. Just to explain, it’s sort of like divorce. You don’t want to get up and get out of bed. It is depressing, and it was a hard period of time and sort of still is. But it gets better every day. Like when you’re divorced, you have to meet new people, and life goes on.
没有。我的婚姻很幸福。不好意思，说“目前还没”不是很合适。我只是想解释，这件事有点像离婚。你不想起床，不愿意下床。很沮丧，这段时间很难熬，而且从某种程度而言，至今仍然如此。但是，情况在一天天好转。就像你离婚之后，还是要去认识人，生活还要继续。
You have to deal with the market and your business and then your personal life. Are you good at compartmentalizing? I think I’ve been able to do that really well. I don’t know if that’s a positive, but I think I can separate it. I went through a nasty divorce years ago and powered through it while building a business and doing well in the market. Maybe that doesn’t speak to being a well-rounded human being. I don’t know.
你需要同时打理市场、你的生意，然后还有你的个人生活。你擅长区分这些东西吗？我认为，我一直处理得非常好。我不知道这算不算有益的事，但我认为我能区分开来。几年前，我经历了一次不愉快的离婚，并竭尽全力地渡过了那个时期；我还创办了一个企业，在市场上的表现很好。或许这无法说明我是一个面面俱到的人。我也不知道。
As an undergraduate at Duke, you majored in psychology. Do you use what you learned there when you invest? You don’t need a degree in psychology to understand human nature. There was an old dude, Jesse Livermore, who wrote a great book that said the most important thing in investing was to know yourself — your weaknesses, your flaws and your strengths.
你在杜克大学(Duke)本科学的是心理学。你在做投资的时候，会利用自己所学吗？要理解人性，你不需要拿心理学的学位。过去有个叫杰西·利弗莫尔(Jesse Livermore)的人，他写了一本伟大的书，书中称，投资中最重要的就是了解自己——你的弱点、你的缺陷和你的长处。
The big question on Wall Street right now is when the Fed will raise interest rates. When do you think they’ll go up? Probably sometime this year. You know, if you’re sick in bed, you’re lying around for 24 hours, at some point you just want to get out of bed and walk around the house for a while. And I think the Fed wants to get off zero, if only to get a sense as to whether they can begin the process of getting healthy again.
目前，华尔街面临的最大的问题就是，美联储将在何时提高利率。你认为利率会何时上涨？可能会在今年。这就像是如果你卧病在床，一天24小时一直躺在那里，你有时就是想起床，在屋子里走动一会儿。我认为，美联储也想摆脱零利率，即便只是看看他们是否可以开始恢复健康的进程了。
Do you think that this low-interest-rate environment has helped or hurt the economy? The savings side of the economy has been damaged. At 2 or 3 percent interest rates, there’s no way insurance companies and pension funds can justify their liabilities and guarantees going forward. Same thing with Mom and Dad and their expectations for education, retirement and so on.
你认为这种低利率的环境对经济有利还是有害？经济在储蓄这个层面上受到了损害。在利率为2%到3%的情况下，保险公司和养老基金根本无法接受他们的潜在保险责任和担保。有子女的人以及他们对教育、退休等问题的期望都是如此。
So what’s the average person supposed to do? Save more. An investor could also take on more risk. I wouldn’t recommend that, but that is something investors are doing, which suggests there’s a bubble.
那么，普通人应该怎么做？把钱更多地存下来。投资者也可以冒更大的险。对此我不推荐，但投资者就是这么做的，这说明这里存在泡沫。
Is the bubble in stocks or in bonds? I think both. I sort of have a sense of an ending. I think that the 35-year bull market in bonds and in stocks is ending. Now, when you say something like that, it conjures up a crash. It doesn’t have to be that way. It probably ends, like T.?S. Eliot said, with a whimper and not a bang.
泡沫在股票市场还是债券市场？我认为两者都有。我隐约感觉结局即将到来。我认为，债券和股票市场持续了35年的牛市即将结束。现在，如果你说出这样的话，就会让人联想起灾难。事情并非总是那样。正如T·?S·艾略特(T.?S. Eliot)所说，它的终结或许不是砰的一声，而是一声抽泣。
I have to know: Why do you wear your tie like that? I came down here to Orange County in ’71 from L.A., and Pimco had this brand-new, beautiful building, but they didn’t have a gym or showers. I was an exercise nut. At noon, I’d change in the bathroom and then run for about five miles. Since there wasn’t a shower, I’d towel off as best I could, but I’d be sweating and hot for an hour or two. So in the afternoon, I began to just not tie my tie. Then a year or two later, I said: “Well, what the hell, I guess I’m not tying it in the afternoon, I’ll just not tie it in the morning either.”
我很想知道：为什么你是这样戴领带的？1971年，我从洛杉矶来到奥兰治县，Pimco有一栋漂亮的新楼，但他们没有健身房，也没有淋浴，而我是运动狂人。下午，我会在洗手间换好衣服，然后跑大概5英里。因为没有淋浴，我只好尽量用毛巾擦干汗水，但是接下来一两个小时，我还会流汗，而且觉得热。所以，我下午就开始不系领带了。然后过了一两年，我说：“好吧，管他的，既然下午不系领带了，那上午干脆也不系了。”
Now you’ve joined Janus Capital Management as portfolio manager. You’re 71. What motivates you to keep doing this? I have an obsessive quality to me. When I left Pimco — or, put it this way, when Pimco left me — it was important to me to prove that they made a mistake.
现在，你作为投资组合经理加入了骏利资产管理公司(Janus Capital Management)。你已经71岁了。你的动力来自哪里？我有一点强迫症。当我离开太平洋的时候——或者说当太平洋离开我时——对我来说，有必要证明他们犯了一个错。
Are you going to do this forever? Well, my wife tells me she married me for better or worse — but not for lunch.
你会一直做这件事吗？我妻子告诉我，她嫁给我算好事坏事说不好——但肯定不是冲着午餐来的。
Another sign of stability in China's economy: China's property prices were deflating at a slower pace for the second month in a row in May.
5月，中国房价跌势连续第二个月趋缓，这是中国经济趋稳的又一个表现。
New home prices in 70 cities fell by an average 5.7 per cent year-on-year last month, based on calculations by Reuters from official data published by China's National Bureau of Statistics. In April , they had also deflated at a record pace of 6.1 per cent. Records go back to 2011.
根据路透社(Reuters)的计算，上个月中国70个城市的新房价格平均同比下跌5.7%。今年4月，房价平均跌幅为6.1%，是2011年有记录以来的最大跌幅。这一结果是路透社根据中国国家统计局(National Bureau of Statistics)的官方数据计算得出的。
The index has been deflating for nine months now, year-on-year, but on a monthly basis there are signs of a pick-up: of the 70 cities tracked, 41 recorded falls last month, versus 47 in April.
该指数已同比连续下跌9个月。不过，环比来看楼市有复苏的迹象：在跟踪研究的70个城市中，上个月有41个城市录得房价下跌，低于4月份的47个城市。
In Beijing prices were down 2.3 per cent year-on-year, versus -3.2 per cent in April. In Shanghai prices slipped 2.3 per cent, from -4.7 per cent in March.
北京房价同比下跌2.3%，相比之下4月份跌幅为3.2%。上海房价同比跌幅2.3%，也低于3月份4.7%的跌幅。
Last week data showed industrial output and retail sales each rising a bit, indicating that stimulative action from Beijing policymakers were filtering through to the economy, which in the three months to March had its slowest quarter in six years.
上周，数据显示中国规模以上工业增加值和社会消费品零售总额均有小幅上涨，表明中国政府采取的刺激举措正在对中国经济产生影响。对于中国经济来说，截至3月份的3个月是6年来增长最慢的一个季度。
Since November the People's Bank of China has cut benchmark interest rates three times. In March it also lowered the minimum downpayment required on second homes.
自去年11月份以来，中国央行(PBoC)已经3次降低基准利率。今年3月，该行还曾下调购买二套房的首付比例。
Chinese imports contracted at their slowest pace since 2014 in May, suggesting government stimulus measures focused on housing and infrastructure are succeeding in stabilising demand.
5月份，中国进口下滑速度降至2014年以来的最低水平，说明中国政府聚焦于楼市和基建的刺激措施正使需求趋稳。
The recent rebound in commodity prices also helped buoy imports, which fell by 0.4 per cent in US dollar value terms last month, less than the 10.9 per cent drop in April and the narrowest monthly decline since October 2014, according to customs data released on Wednesday.
大宗商品价格近期的反弹也帮助推升了进口。中国海关周三发布的数据显示，上个月以美元计的进口额同比下降0.4%，是2014年10月以来的最小月度降幅。4月份的同比降幅为10.9%。
Exports were less rosy, falling 4.1 per cent in May against a 1.8 per cent decline in April, reflecting sluggish demand in Europe and the US. Analysts had forecast an import decline of 6 per cent and an export decline of 3.6 per cent, according to a Reuters poll.
出口数据则没有这么喜人。5月份，出口额同比下滑4.1%，幅度大于4月份的下滑1.8%，反映出欧美需求疲软。路透社(Reuters)一项调查显示，分析师原本预期进口下滑6%，出口下滑3.6%。
“The import figure reflects the recovery of domestic demand but it’s partly also the low base of comparison from last year. It’s not only prices, import volumes also rose. In general, it shows domestic demand isn’t as poor as everyone imagines,” said Hu Yanni, economist at China Securities in Beijing.
中信建投证券(China Securities)驻北京经济学家胡艳妮表示：“进口数字反映出国内需求的复苏，但它在一定程度上也是由去年的比较基数较低所致。不只是进口价格，进口量也上升了。总体上说，这表明国内需求并不像大家想象的那么糟。”
Dollar-denominated imports from Hong Kong surged by a record 242.6 per cent year on year in May, suggesting no let-up in the ploy of over-invoicing to move cash out of China.
5月份，以美元计的来自香港的进口同比激增了创纪录的242.6%，说明通过虚开发票将现金转移出中国的做法并未减少。
Inflating the value of imports from Hong Kong to China is an old ruse that has regained popularity this year as authorities in China clamp down on official channels of taking cash abroad.
虚报从香港进口至中国内地的商品的价值，是一种老招数。今年，在中国当局对把现金转移出境的官方渠道加以限制之际，这种招数又火了起来。
China’s merchandise trade surplus rose to $50bn in May, the largest monthly figure since January, helping to offset ongoing capital outflows last month.
5月份，中国商品贸易顺差攀升至500亿美元，是1月份以来最高的，这帮助抵消了上个月的持续资本外流。
The outlook on imports for the remainder of the year depends largely on whether a surge in monetary and fiscal stimulus, which began late last year, continues.
今年接下来的进口前景，很大程度上取决于去年底开始大力加强的货币和财政刺激能否持续下去。
If the government vigorously implements promises to cut overcapacity in basic manufacturing industries such as steel and non-ferrous metals, that would also crimp demand for commodity imports.
此外，如果中国政府积极履行承诺、削减钢铁和有色金属等基础制造业的过剩产能，也会抑制大宗商品的进口需求。
As the central government continues to tighten restrictions in the housing market, a stand-off between home buyers and sellers appears to be cooling the market and worrying property developers.
随着中央政府继续收紧对房地产市场的调控，购房者与卖方的对峙似乎正在给房市降温、引发房地产开发商担忧。
Sales of China Vanke, the country's largest residential developer, declined 16.4% month-on-month to 2.42 million sq m in May, with the value down 14.3% to 35.89 billion yuan, the company said in a statement to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
我国最大住宅开发商万科集团在向深圳证券交易所提交的公告中称，5月，该公司的销售面积环比下降16.4%至242万平方米，销售金额环比下降14.3%至358.9亿元。
China Vanke was not the only property developer feeling the pinch.
感受到压力的房地产开发商并非只有万科一家。
About 70% of the 40 property developers monitored by property research center CRIC saw sales value decrease from April.
房地产研究中心克而瑞监测的40家房地产开发商中，约七成开发商的销售金额较4月有所下滑。
Combined sales value of the 40 companies fell 10% month-on-month.
这40家开发商的总销售金额环比下降了10%。
Zhu Xu, secretary of the China Vanke board, said the company expected the situation to be more severe in the second half of this year.
万科董事会秘书朱旭表示，万科预计今年下半年的形势将更加严峻。
Activity in China's services sector expanded for the fourth month in a row in May.
今年5月，中国服务业连续第4个月呈扩张态势。
Compiled by HSBC and Markit, China's services purchasing managers index rose to 53.5 last month, from a reading of 52.9 in April, and remaining above the threshold of 50 that separates expansion from contraction. It was the fastest rate of activity growth in eight months, noted HSBC/Markit.
5月，由汇丰银行(HSBC)和Markit共同编制的中国服务业PMI上升至53.5，高于4月的52.9，仍然位于荣枯分界线之上。这是8个月来中国服务业扩张速度最快的一次。
There were a number of positive trends from the services industry in May, including an increase in new work (and at its sharpest pace in three years) and service sector employment rising at its fastest pace since January 2013. Backlogs of work at services firms fell for a fourth consecutive month, and confidence toward the services sector remained strong.
5月服务业出现了大量的积极趋势，包括新岗位（增速为三年来最高）以及服务业就业人数的增长为2013年1月以来最快速度。服务业企业的积压工作连续第4个月减少，行业信心仍然强劲。
That helped to offset the more disappointing picture of manufacturing activity within the month, and kept the so-called composite reading relatively steady at 51.2, from 51.3 in April.
这有利于平衡5月制造业疲弱的负面影响，使得5月中国综合PMI相对稳定在51.2，4月则为51.3。
Annabel Fiddes, economist at Markit said: Overall, growth momentum appears relatively weak, weighed down by an ongoing deterioration in manufacturing operating conditions, therefore further stimulus measures may be required to keep up with an annual GDP growth target of 7%.
Markit经济学家安娜贝尔?菲德斯(Annabel Fiddes)表示：“总体上看，在制造业经营状况持续恶化的影响下，经济增长势头似乎相对较弱，因此中国或许要推出更多刺激政策，才能完成7%的年度GDP增长目标。”
A buyer has reportedly paid $61 million for an apartment perched in one of Hong Kong's loftiest neighborhoods, setting another stunning record in a city already known for its sky-high prices.
据报道，有人花6,100万美元的价钱买下一套公寓，在已经因房价奇高而闻名的香港创下了又一个令人瞠目结舌的纪录。这套公寓位于香港地理位置最高的社区之一。
The apartment sold is situated on the city's Peak and is part of architect Frank Gehry's first creation in Asia, the Opus. The building, which was completed in March, has an undulating glass facade that curves and offers each floor a distinct vista of the surrounding leafy environs. Last year, project developer Swire Properties' chief executive declared the company had 'every expectation it will break records.' Analysts said Monday that the price paid is the highest ever fetched in Hong Kong. Local media reports also said that for a unit sized at 6,200 square feet, it was the highest price per square foot ever paid in Asia and the second-highest in the world, after London's One Hyde Park.
这套公寓位于香港山顶区，是建筑师弗兰克?盖里(Frank Gehry)首件亚洲作品“Opus”的一部分。这栋今年3月份完工的大楼有着弯曲的玻璃幕 ，从每一层楼都能看到周围郁郁葱葱的独特景观。去年项目开发商太古地产(Swire Properties)的行政总裁宣称公司完全相信它会打破纪录。分析师周一说，前述售价是香港有史有来卖出的最高价格。当地媒体报道也说，这套6,200平方英尺（576平方米）公寓的单价已经是亚洲有史以来最高，在世界上仅次于伦敦的海德公园一号(One Hyde Park)，位居第二。
Centaline Property Agency Head of Research Wong Leung-sing said the price didn't surprise him, given the fame of its architect. 'They're selling it not as an apartment, they're selling it as a masterpiece,' said Mr. Wong. 'It's just like buying artwork.'
中原地产(Centaline Property Agency)研究部负责人黄良升说，考虑到建筑师的名气，这个价格没有出乎他的意料。黄良升说，他们不是把它当一套公寓出售，而是把它当成一件杰作来出售，就像是在买卖艺术品一样。
Swire had earlier announced that it intended to lease the dozen apartments that make up the site, which a spokeswoman on Monday declared was still the company's overall plan. 'We do get inquiries from time to time,' she said. 'If it's an exceptional offer, we'll consider it.' The company declined to confirm the Opus purchase or reveal any details about the property's leasing progress to date, though the spokeswoman noted that one unit was recently leased for HK$850,000 (US$110,000) per month.
太古地产早些时候曾宣布说，它打算出租大楼里的12套公寓。一位发言人周一称这仍是公司的总体打算。她说，时不时会有人来问我们；如果出价非常高的话，我们是会考虑的。太古地产拒绝证实前述6,100万美元的买卖，也不愿透露有关“Opus”出租进度的任何细节。不过发言人提到，最近有一套公寓租出了每月85万港元（11万美元）的价格。
Hong Konghas seen its share of vertigo-inducing records before, including the 2009 sale of an apartment for $56.6 million. The city's financial secretary, John Tsang, has warned repeatedly about the risk of a bubble emerging. Since 2011, the cost of renting luxury housing has jumped 15% in Hong Kong, where it now costs over $11,800 to rent an unfurnished, three-bedroom apartment in a desirable neighborhood, according to human-resources consulting firm ECA International.
香港过去也曾创下令人眩晕的纪录，比如2009年一套公寓就卖出了5,660万美元。财政司司长曾俊华曾反复警告出现泡沫的风险。2011年以来，香港豪宅租赁价格已经上涨15%。人力资源咨询公司ECA International说，现在要在某个令人满意的社区里租一套不含家具的三居室公寓，租金已经超过11,800美元。
Hong Kong property prices exceeded 1997 peak levels last year, despite the recent adoption of various government cooling measures, including taxes to try and curb speculation. Such high prices in Hong Kong have increasingly served as a flashpoint for local anger, particularly given the influx of mainland buyers in the past few years, which has helped bid up prices in a city already parched for affordable housing.
虽然最近政府采取包括征税在内的多种冷却措施来遏制投机，香港房价还是在去年超过了1997年创下的最高水平。如此高的房价在当地引起了越来越多的民怨，特别是考虑到过去几年内地买家涌入本已极缺便宜住房的香港，从一定程度上造成当地房价进一步走高。
However, Mr. Wong said he believes that the impact of the Opus' head-turning sale on the market will be limited. If other developers are determined to set similar records, he said, 'they'll need to find a great artist to work with them first.'
但黄良升说，他相信“Opus”所卖高价对市场的影响将是有限的。他说，如果其他开发商也想创下相似纪录，他们首先得找一位了不起的艺术家跟他们合作。
Mr Bean star Rowan Atkinson is to become a dad again – at the age of 62.
扮演憨豆先生而出名的演员罗温·艾金森在62岁的时候要又要当爹啦~
The comedy legend's actress partner Louise Ford, 33, is expecting their first child in the next few weeks.
他的女伴是现年33岁的喜剧女演员路易斯·福特。几周后，他们就要迎来第一个孩子。
Rowan already has son Ben, 23, and daughter Lily, 21, from his marriage to Sunetra Sastry.
艾金森和前妻苏内特拉·塞斯崔(SunetraSastry)育有一子本恩，现年23岁和一女莉莉，21岁。
He began dating Louise – who plays Kate Middleton in hit Channel 4 comedy The Windsors – in 2014 after separating from Sunetra.
在2014年与苏内特拉分开后，憨豆开始和路易斯约会，路易斯曾在Channel 4 的喜剧《温莎王室Windsors》中扮演凯特·米德尔顿。
The following year his 25-year marriage ended after a 65-second court hearing. And a year later Louise moved in to his 4.65million cottage in North London.
65秒的庭审结束了憨豆25年的婚姻。在离婚一年以后路易斯就搬进了憨豆位于伦敦北部价值465万英镑（约为4049.7万人名币）的郊外别墅中。
A source said: “Rowan and Louise are over the moon and can't wait for their new arrival. It's a very happy time for them both.”
据消息：“艾金森和路易斯都非常开心，迫不及待的希望这个小生命的快点来临，对于他们来说是个异常美好的时刻。”
The couple – who met in 2012 when they acted together in West End comedy Quatermaine's Terms – come from very different backgrounds.
2012年，他们因共同参演西区的喜剧《奎特梅因的任期》而结识，两个人的背景差异很大。
Louise grew up in Bexley, South East London, where she went to the local grammar school. Her father was a gas fitter and her mother worked with disabled people.
路易斯生长在英国的西南部城市贝克斯利，就读于当地的文法学校，他的父亲是个煤气装修工，母亲和残疾人一起工作。
After studying English at Southampton University she went to RADA acting school, alongside future stars Tom Hiddleston and Gemma Arterton.
在南安普敦大学学习英文以后她去了拉达表演学校，和日后的明星抖森和杰玛·阿特登是校友。
She said: “My parents were proud when I went to Uni, less pleased when I wanted to be an actor, then more pleased when I went to Rada.”
她说：“我的父母为我能上大学感到骄傲，但对于我想成为演员有点不悦，但是为我能去达拉表演学校而很开心。”
She appeared in Channel 4 comedy drama Crashing before landing her royal role in The Windsors, but jokes: “My mother would love it if I was in Midsomer Murders.”
在出演喜剧《温莎王室Windsors》的王妃角色前，她曾出演《情迷意乱》，路易斯开玩笑说：“除非我演Midsomer Murders《杀机四伏》,她才会很喜欢。”
Privately-educated Rowan, whose dad was a farmer in Consett, County Durham, went to Oxford University before finding fame in cult comedy sketch show Not The Nine O'Clock News.
从小受私立教育的罗文，父亲是达勒姆郡康塞特的农民。在他因喜剧《非9点新闻》而一举成名之前，他在牛津大学就读。
He has built an estimated 70million fortune from classic roles including the bumbling vicar in Four Weddings and a Funeral, and scheming Blackadder in four series of historical sitcom. His silent Mr Bean character – first seen in 1990 – has appeared in three hit movies so far. And he played him in the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
他的经典角色包括电影《四个婚礼和一个葬礼》中的装模作样的牧师，四大历史惊喜剧中足智多谋的BlackAdder黑爵士，1990年面世的无声喜剧《憨豆先生》。这三部是他受欢迎的电影为他创造了约合7000万英镑（约合6亿元人名币）的财富。2012年，他参加了伦敦奥运会开幕仪式中的表演。
Last month it was reported that Lily had dropped her father's surname to use her mother's instead. One friend said: “It's a real mystery.” Rowan has insisted he is “on board” with her career but apparently nodded off in the audience as she performed last year.
上个月，有报道莉莉放弃父性，改随了母姓。一个朋友说：“现在的他们的关系实在不好。”虽然罗文坚称自己在事业上帮助了女儿，但去年，莉莉在表演的时候，台下的观众有的都睡着了。
He said: “It is bizarre. I try not to think about it too much. If I ever do stop and dwell on how well known my face is in so many obscure places of the world then I think I would find it quite disturbing.”
他说：“这种感觉好怪，我试着不要多想。但是我还是忍不住，想到住在世界犄角旮旯的地方都认识我，我觉得好无奈。”
And he once admitted that when he isn't portraying a character he “can be funny” but only “when I am with very good friends in small rooms and I'm very relaxed”.
他也承认，他并非刻意扮演成一个“滑稽的人”，但是“只有小范围的和关系很好的朋友在一起他才会觉得没有拘束。”
Pregnant Louise was seen shopping in North London last week...sporting one of bungling Mr Bean's proudest bumps so far. Rowan's spokesman declined to comment.
上周怀孕的路易斯挺着大肚，里面是憨豆先生的引以为傲的骨肉，被拍到在伦敦北部逛街，对此罗文的发言人拒绝回应。
Jackie Chan, the 62-year-old Chinese kung fu giant, hopes he could continue to shoot death-defying stunts for the movie fans.
62岁的中国功夫巨星成龙希望能继续为影迷们呈现玩命的特技效果。
He may be 62, but Chinese kung fu legend Jackie Chan has no plans to stop performing death-defying stunts anytime soon.
虽然已经62岁，但作为中国功夫电影传奇人物的成龙，短期内丝毫没有停止在电影中加入大量玩命特技的打算。
"I love cinema. Movies are my life. I'll fight on the big screen for those who love films," Chan told a recent Beijing event promoting his upcoming feature, Kung Fu Yoga.
日前，成龙在新电影《功夫瑜伽》的北京发布会上表示：“我爱电影。电影是我的生命。我要在大荧幕上为那些电影爱好者们奋斗。”。
"How time flies. I don't know how many more years I'll still be able to shoot such action-packed movies," he says.
他说道：“光阴似箭，我不知道我还能再演几年动作电影了。”
Chan was seriously injured when shooting the Kung Fu Yoga in Iceland last year. But he insisted on returning to the set a few days after a five-hour operation.
《功夫瑜伽》去年在冰岛拍摄时，成龙就曾严重受伤。但在长达五小时的手术几天之后，他就坚持回到剧组继续拍摄。
The movie marks the eighth time Chan has teamed up with Hong Kong director Stanley Tong, who made Chan a Hollywood icon in the 1990s.
这部电影也是成龙和香港导演唐季礼的第八次合作，而正是唐季礼促使成龙在九十年代进军好莱坞的。
Their previous hits include Rumble in the Bronx, Rush Hour and The Myth.
他们之前合作的影片《红番区》、《尖峰时刻》以及《神话》等都非常成功。
After recently announcing her divorce from Arthur Becker, Vera Wang may already have moved on with a new man, according to reports.
据报道，婚纱女王王薇薇与丈夫亚瑟-贝克刚刚宣布离婚，就已另结新欢。
New reports have stated that Vera Wang may now be dating Evan Lysacek, 27, the 2010 Winter Olympics gold medal winner in figure skating. Wang herself has experience on the ice. The 63-year-old began her fashion career after failing to win a spot on the US Olympic figure skating team, quite a few years ago.
报道称，王薇薇与27岁的埃文-雷萨切克传出恋情。雷萨切克是2010年冬奥会花样滑冰冠军。王薇薇也曾是一名花样滑冰运动员。很多年前，她在落选美国奥运花样滑冰代表队之后，转而开始了自己的时尚事业。
Just last week representatives for the designer released a statement, revealing that Wang was planning on divorcing her husband of 23 years.
就在上周，王薇薇的发言人发表声明称，王薇薇将与结婚23年的丈夫离婚。
"Vera Wang and Arthur Becker have mutually and amicably agreed to separate. They remain devoted parents to their two daughters," Mario Grauso said in a statement.
马里奥-格劳索在声明中说：“王薇薇和亚瑟-贝克共同决定和平分手。他们仍将对两个女儿尽职尽责。”
That Wang would be dating someone else, however, comes as a surprise for someone who claimed to be too dedicated to her career to have time for relationships.
但王薇薇可能在约会其他人，这个消息让众人大惊，因为王薇薇曾宣称献身于事业，无暇顾及感情问题。
"I was the girl who nobody thought would ever get married," she told New York magazine in 2006.
她在2006年接受《纽约杂志》采访时说：“没人想到我还会结婚。”
"I was going to be a fashion nun the rest of my life. There are generations of them, those fashion nuns, living, eating, breathing clothes."
“我会把余生献给时尚事业。一代又一代的时装人把事业当作自己的全部。”
It was her fellow colleague, Ralph Lauren, that inspired her to continue her journey in life alongside a partner.
她的同行拉尔夫?劳伦使她有了寻找生活伴侣的打算。
"Get yourself a husband and a family," Wang recalled Lauren saying. "You have got to get a family going here. You've been single for three decades now."
王薇薇回忆说，“劳伦对我说，找个丈夫成家吧。你必须成家了，你已经单身30年了。”
However, despite having two daughters, Wang was still unsure about her decision at times and not always willing to separate herself from work.
尽管已经有了两个女儿，但王薇薇对自己的决定有时仍心生动摇，而且不愿意从工作中分心。
But the New York Daily News has now reported that Lysacek has moved in with the iconic fashion designer. The pair attended Kim Kardashian's wedding last October and have been close for a while, sources say, although new speculation has raised the question of whether the two are now more than friends.
但《纽约每日新闻》报道说，雷萨切克已经搬去和王薇薇同住。据消息人士透露，两人曾在去年10月一同出席金-卡戴珊的婚礼，关系一度很亲密，尽管仍有猜测认为两人关系还不确定。
Movers and shakers of the film world are boarding yachts or jets to head for the once sleepy Mediterranean seaside town of Cannes for a 12-day party that also serves as a film festival, with this year's lineup heavy on drama and light on humor. The 67th Cannes Film Festival gets under way on Wednesday with 18 films showing in the main competition for the Palme d'Or prize awarded by a majority female jury headed by New Zealand director Jane Campion, the only woman ever to receive the top Cannes award for her 1993 film "The Piano".
电影界的明星大腕正搭乘游艇或飞机前往曾一度沉睡的地中海海滨小镇——戛纳，参加为期十二天的电影节盛宴，今年入围的竞赛片重点是情节剧而非幽默剧。第67届戛纳电影节将于本周三如约开幕，18部入围主竞赛单元的影片将角逐今年的金棕榈奖。本届评委会成员多是女性，新西兰导演珍·坎皮恩（Jane Campion）担任本届电影节评委会主席。1993年她已凭借影片《钢琴课》荣获金棕榈奖，成为迄今为止唯一获得过戛纳电影节最高奖项的的女性导演。
Another 20 films are in the "Un Certain Regard" strand, plus dozens more in the "Directors' Fortnight", the "Critics' Week" and other festival showcases. And, providing the customary dash of controversy, the opening film - "Grace of Monaco" - has been denounced as a "farce" by the late princess's three children.
另有20部影片入选“一种关注单元”，此外超过12部影片在“导演双周” 、“影评人周 ”以及其他影展中播出，一如既往引发热议，如开幕电影——《摩纳哥王妃》，遭到已故王妃三个孩子的谴责，称其为一场“闹剧”。
Cannes is "insane, very intense and fun", said Canadian director David Cronenberg, a Cannes regular whose "Maps to the Stars" starring "Twilight" teen vampire series idol Robert Pattinson as a Hollywood wannabe is in competition.
加拿大导演大卫·柯南伯格，戛纳电影节上的常客，称戛纳电影节“疯狂、激烈却有趣”。他的新作《星座》入围主竞赛单元，主演罗伯特·帕丁森 （Robert Pattinson）（《暮光之城》少年吸血鬼系列影片的主演），出演一个好莱坞明星的追崇者。
British director Mike Leigh, a past winner of the Palme d'Or, whose "Mr Turner" is based on the life of the British landscape painter J.M.W. Turner, said screening a film at Cannes is "a great experience".
英国导演迈克·李（Mike Leigh）是曾经的金棕榈奖得主，他的参赛电影《透纳先生》演绎了英国风景画家约瑟夫?玛罗德?威廉?透纳（J.M.W. Turner）的一生。他说在戛纳电影节上放映电影是一种“很棒的体验。”
"I'm always delighted to be there. I think it's my fifth time in competition and I was on the jury so I'm glad to go there with something to do," he said.
“我总是很高兴地参加戛纳电影节。我想这是我第五次入选正式竞赛单元。我还担任过评委，所以我很高兴可以在电影节上有事可做。”
For Turkish director Nuri Ceylan, whose "Winter Sleep" is in competition and whose films have regularly won awards at Cannes, "this is an opportunity to showcase the country and its film business because this is where the heart of the industry beats", his producer, Zeynep Ozbatur, told Reuters.
土耳其导演努里·比格·锡兰的作品《冬眠》 入围主竞赛单元，他是戛纳电影节的获奖专业户。其制片人泽伊内普·奥兹巴特（Zeynep Ozbatur）告诉路透社记者：“这是个展现国家和电影产业的机会，因为这是电影人为之心潮澎湃的地方。”
American director Bennett Miller's "Foxcatcher" is based on the murder of a championship wrestler by an heir to the DuPont chemical fortune. "The Search" by French director Michel Hazanavicius ("The Artist") is set in war-torn Chechnya.
美国导演贝尼特·米勒的竞赛片《狐狸猎手》是根据杜邦化学集团继承人谋杀一位奥运金牌摔跤手的真实故事改编而成。
American actor-director Tommy Lee Jones's "The Homesman" is a frontier drama starring himself and Meryl Streep while other Cannes veterans in competition include France's Jean-Luc Godard with "Adieu au Langage" and Canada's Atom Egoyan with "The Captive".
美国演员同时也是导演汤米·李·琼斯（Tommy Lee Jones）自导自演的影片《送乡人》入围主竞赛单元，奥斯卡影后梅丽尔·斯特里普也将出演，该片是关于美国拓荒时期的情节片。同时入围的还有法国名导让吕克-戈达尔的作品《再见语言》和加拿大导演阿托姆·伊戈扬的《人质》。
Add in 25-year-old Xavier Dolan's "Mommy", and Canada has three films in competition to two for the United States, which Cronenberg said is a bit like a victory in the two neighbors' eternal hockey rivalry.
此外还有25岁加拿大导演哈维尔·多兰的竞赛片《妈咪》。本届戛纳电影节有三部加拿大影片入围主竞赛单元，而美国有两部入围。加拿大鬼才导演大卫·柯南伯格说入围主竞赛单元有点儿像两个邻居参加曲棍球比赛，其中一方获得了胜利。
MOSTLY "OLD EUROPE", AMERICAN ENTRIES
主力军来自“老欧洲”和美国
"The interesting thing for me is how much this lineup relies really on 'Old Europe' and America - there are a few Asian films, no German films, very few from Scandinavia and not much from Eastern Europe or Russia," said Scott Roxborough, Berlin bureau chief for The Hollywood Reporter.
《好莱坞记者报》柏林分社社长斯科特·罗克斯伯勒说：“我觉得有趣之处在于这些竞赛片都出自‘老欧洲’和美国，小部分出自亚洲，很少一部分出自斯堪的纳维亚半岛，而且东欧或俄国并不多。”
"So it's a lot of familiar faces but also familiar areas - lots of French films, as you always have, a fair chunk of American films and others from places we've seen before."
“所以我们可以看到许多老面孔和熟悉的国家——许多法国电影，这已是惯例，还有相当一部分是美国电影，此外还有我们之前熟悉的国家地区。”
But a party is a party and there is something for every taste. Cannes will host the world premiere of the "How to Train Your Dragon 2" sequel to the animation blockbuster, as well as a blast-from-the-past showing of a restored version of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" cult horror classic from 1974.
戛纳电影节不愧为电影节的狂欢派对，在戛纳，众口不再难调。戛纳电影节将举行续集动画大片《驯龙高手2》全球首映，同时首映的还有1974年至今的经典恐怖片《德州电锯杀人狂》恢复版，让大家重温昔日经典。
The festival also is known for controversy and already has one for this year: its opening film, "Grace of Monaco", starring Nicole Kidman as American actress Grace Kelly who married Prince Rainier of Monaco and died after crashing her car in 1982 in hills above the principality, not far to the east of Cannes.
戛纳电影节总是引发热议，今年也毫不例外。妮可·基德曼主演的《摩纳哥王妃》将聚焦美国演员格蕾丝·凯莉（Grace Kelly），摩洛哥王子雷尼尔三世（Rainier）的王妃，1982年在距离戛纳东部不远处因遭遇车祸罹难。
For months, the trade press has been reporting that the film's French director, Olivier Dahan, and producer Harvey Weinstein, who owns the American distribution rights, have been sparring over the final cut.
几个月来，出版社相继报道该片法国电影导演奥利维埃·达昂（Olivier Dahan）和他拥有美国分销权的制片人哈维·韦恩斯坦（Harvey Weinstein）已在商讨影片的最终剪辑。
This month the Monaco royal family weighed in, calling the film a "farce". Prince Albert and his sisters - Kelly's children Caroline and Stephanie - said a trailer "confirms the totally fictional nature of this film".
这个月，包括艾伯特王子在内的摩纳哥王室成员、凯莉的孩子：卡洛琳和斯蒂芬妮，斥责这部电影是场“闹剧”，“从预告片看，证实了该影片全属虚构的本质。”
Asked about the dispute last month, Thierry Fremaux, the festival's director, alluded to French law which stipulates that a film's director decides on the final cut.
上个月戛纳电影节艺术总监蒂埃里·弗雷莫（Thierry Fremaux）被问及此事，他指出法国法律规定电影导演有电影的最终剪辑权。
"We're in France, and at Cannes, the only version is the version of the director," Fremaux said.
弗雷莫说道：“无论在法国还是在戛纳，最终的版本是导演敲定的版本。”
A whiff of scandal is good for business and Cannes has reliably produced its share ever since the 18-year-old bikinied Brigitte Bardot allowed Hollywood leading man Kirk Douglas to play with her hair in a famous 1953 photo shoot on the beach.
无伤大雅的丑闻有益于商业发展。戛纳电影节确也制造了不少“丑闻”。自从1953年以来，戛纳允许拍摄此类照片——画面上好莱坞男主角柯克·道格拉斯（Kirk Douglas）在沙滩上撩拨着18岁身着比基尼的法国影星碧姬·芭杜（Brigitte Bardot）的秀发。
The festival is a media magnet and Cronenberg, who won a jury prize at Cannes in 1996 for his film-noir "Crash", says that is exactly what independent producers, like him, want.
戛纳电影节如磁铁般吸引了众多媒体。大卫·柯南伯格1996年凭借其黑色电影《欲望号快车》获得评委会大奖。他说道：“这正是一个像他一样的独立制片人所期盼的。”
In a telephone interview he said he would probably do at least 500 interviews in Cannes, providing publicity for his new movie the likes of which he could not get anywhere else.
在电话采访中，柯南伯格说他在戛纳可能还要至少500个访谈，这给他的新作以其他地方可能没办法达到的宣传效果。
"As an independent we can't afford to send the cast all over the world ... (So) it's a fantastic venue to promote a movie."
“作为一名独立电影人，我们负担不起演员在全球各地宣传新片……所以这是宣传新片的绝妙场所。”
The "wow" and name-recognition factors for Cannes are what seem to set it apart.
戛纳电影节令人惊叹的知名度是它区别于其他影展的主要因素。
"It has a magical ring," said British screenwriter Stephen Beresford, whose film "Pride" will be shown out of competition.
英国编剧斯蒂芬·贝雷斯福德（Stephen Beresford）的影片《骄傲》将会在非主竞赛单元片区播出，他称戛纳电影节为“魔戒”。
"When you ring your mum and say your film's got into a film festival, when you say 'Cannes', she knows what you mean."
“当你打电话给你的母亲并告诉她‘你的电影入围电影节啦’，当你说出‘戛纳’时，她知道你的意思。”
Procrastinating could easily be the sweetest thing in the world, if deadlines did not exist. With a mountain-like load of work waiting to crush you under its weight, you cannot afford to waste time. Here are some simple steps that will help keep you focused during the day.
要是没有最后期限这回事，拖延可谓是世界上最美好的事情了。面对堆积如山的任务，在如此重压之下，你再也不能浪费时间了。下面是能帮助你集中注意力的几个小方法。
1. Evaluate Your Actions
1、懂得孰轻孰重
The first step to correct your procrastinating tendencies is to ascertain the activities that tempt you to distraction. Do you check your email more than often? Do you spend your productive office hours aimlessly surfing the web? Do you spend too much time doodling when you should be writing? Once you know your evils, you will find the initiative to keep away from these activities.
改善拖延症的第一步就是要确定分散你注意力的行为有哪些。你是不是太爱查邮件了？是不是花费了宝贵的工作时间去浏览网页？在该写点什么的时候你是不是又花了好多时间乱涂鸦？一旦知道了问题所在，你就会自动克制这些行为了。
2. Break it Down
2、合理分配时间
Create a schedule that allows ample time for work and play, such that it does not end up overburdening you. Procrastination begins with mental picture of having too much to do. Work for some time and then do something fun to take your mind off things. Juxtaposing hard work with leisurely activities will help keep you from wasting time.
你的时间表必须为工作和休闲安排足够的时间，这样你才不会被压垮！当你意识到有太多要做的事情时，拖延已经开始了。可以工作一会儿然后玩一会来理清思绪。努力工作之余别忘放松，这样能帮你节省不少时间。
3. Avoid Distractions
3、排除干扰
You don’t need to constantly check your phone for emails, or missed calls when you should be busy working. Avoid all distractions if you want to be able to focus on your work. Assign time to check your email and let your answering machine or voice mail take your messages. Eliminating these distractions will help provide an hour or two for productive use.
你忙时根本不用一直看手机，生怕错过一封邮件或一个电话。想要集中精力干活，就排除一切的干扰吧。专门空出时间来查邮件和回复信息。排除这些干扰能让你多出一到两个小时的工作时间。
4. Organise Your Desk
4、整理桌子
A lot of unsolicited laziness arises from cluttered work environments. Cluttered work tables consume a lot of energy to clean and thus give way to laziness. Organise your table in such a way that each and every thing is in its rightful place, so that when you need something, you will not need to rummage your entire office space for it.
很多时候懒惰来自于周围乱糟糟的环境。乱糟糟的工作台会让你花费精力去整理，给自己偷懒找到借口。把桌子整理干净，让每个东西都在应该在的地方。这样当你需要什么的时候，就不必翻遍整个桌子来找了。
5. Respect the Schedule
5、遵守时间表
Making a schedule is fruitless if you do not power through your laziness to do everything to follow it. You need to understand that the schedule is only an aid to help you stay focussed. If you lack focus on your part then nothing will be able to help you complete the task at hand.
如果你并不遵守时间表，那就只是一纸空文而已，毫无意义。你需要明白，时间表是唯一能使你注意力一直保持集中的办法。如果你缺乏注意力，就再也没有什么能帮你完成手边的任务了。
6. Multitask
6、混合完成工作
If your reasons to waste time stem from the prospect of too much work, try and juxtapose activities and perform them simultaneously. For example, you can create your annual presentation and print your sales report at the same time. Doing multiple tasks at once will not only minimise your workload, but will also keep your senses completely consumed to be able to waste any time at all. By following the above-mentioned steps, you will be able to absolve your sins and work hard.
如果你浪费时间的借口是工作实在太多，那么试着时不时的放松一下。例如，你可以同时准备年度讲演和销售报告。把各项任务混着做不仅可以将你的工作量减到最小，还能使你完全没有精力去浪费时间。做好上述的步骤，你就能减轻罪恶感努力工作了。
A little girl got at least six lesions on her face thanks to her teacher after failing to give a correct answer to a mathematics question.
因没有算对算术题的答案，一名小女孩被老师在脸上扎了六个洞。
A woman surnamed Wang, mother of Xiaoxiao (pseudo), said she found her six-year-old daughter's face inflamed with six scars and two scratch marks after her husband brought her home at about 7 p.m. on Nov. 17, according to Henan Business Daily.
据《河南商报》报道，该名小女孩名叫笑笑（化名），今年六岁。她的妈妈王女士表示，11月17号晚上，她的丈夫将女儿带回家后，自己便发现女儿脸上多了六个洞，还伴有两处划痕。
Xiaoxiao said the teacher of an extracurricular class poked her face with nine pencils because she did not correctly calculate the result of 10 plus 9.
对此笑笑回答道，因为自己没有算对“10+9”的答案，培训班老师便拿九支铅笔朝她脸上扎去。
Teacher Zhao admitted to the incident, but explained it was all because of carelessness.
随后培训班赵老师承认了自己的行为，并解释自己是不小心扎的。
Xiaoxiao's mother said the extracurricular class management handled the issue lightly, continuing to post special achievements in a group after the girl was injured.
笑笑妈妈表示，这家培训班的管理部门对此事丝毫不重视，女儿出事之后还继续对外鼓吹自己的办学成就，并未就此事给一个说法。
Further investigation showed the class has no license to operate, according to the local education bureau of Gaoxin District, Zheng Zhou City, central China's Henan Province.
经过进一步调查，河南省郑州市高新区教育局发现，这家培训班根本没有营业执照，属于非法办学。
A lawyer said the incident involved corporal punishment and child abuse, and that the teacher involved would be punished in accordance with the law.
一位律师表示，这件事涉及到体罚和虐待儿童，根据法律，伤人者赵老师应该受到相应的惩罚。
Children as young as six feel fear, rage and despair as a result of "mathematics anxiety", a condition which can cause physical symptoms and behaviour problems in class, according to a study.
根据一项研究报道，6岁的小孩子因为“数学焦虑”而感到害怕，愤怒，以及绝望，这种情况可能在课上引起孩子们的生理性症状及行为问题。
Pupils in both primary and secondary school can find themselves locked in a cycle of despair, suffering from anxiety which harms their maths performance, which in turn leads to increased anxiety.
中小学生发现焦虑会使他们的数学成绩降低，而数学成绩降低反过来又让他们更加焦虑，他们陷入了绝望的循环。
Researchers say maths anxiety should be treated as a "real concern" because of the damage it does to a child's learning. They also point out it may be contributing to a growing maths crisis in the UK, where the level of adult numeracy is relatively low and getting worse.
研究人员说，数学焦虑应该被视为一种“真正的担忧”，因为它会损害孩子的学习能力。他们还指出，这可能是导致英国日益严重的数学危机的原因，在英国，成人算术水平相对较低，而且还在恶化。
According to the Nuffield Foundation report, Understanding Mathematics Anxiety, the proportion of adults with functional maths skills equivalent to a GCSE grade C has fallen from 26% in 2003 to 22% in 2011. In contrast, functional literacy skills are steadily increasing, with 57% of working-age adults gaining the equivalent level.
根据NF报道，为了理解数学焦虑，成年人应用数学技能达到GCSE成绩C的比例，在2003的26%已经降到22% 到2011。相比之下，应用读写能力正平稳地上升，有57%的成年人达到同样C成绩的水平。
Researchers from the faculty of education and the centre for neuroscience in education at Cambridge University worked with 2,700 primary and secondary students in the UK and Italy – including detailed one-to-one interviews – to explore maths anxiety and its causes.
来自剑桥大学教育学院和神经科学教育中心的研究人员与英国和意大利的2700名中小学生进行了合作，包括详细的一对一访谈，以探讨数学焦虑及其原因。
The children they interviewed provided graphic descriptions of their fears about maths. "I felt very unwell and I was really scared," said one primary school student, describing his reaction during a lesson about equivalent fractions. "Because my table's in the corner I kind of tried not to be in the lesson."
他们采访的孩子们形象地描述了他们对数学的恐惧。“我感觉很不舒服，我真的很害怕，”一名小学生说。他描述了他在一堂关于等效分数的课上的反应。“因为我的桌子在角落里，所以我尽量逃课。”
The co-author Dr Ros McLellan, who led the interview research, said: "Maths anxiety is very much an emotional reaction. Younger kids won't want to go to school when they have maths classes; they get tearful and upset.
共同作者RosMcLellan博士领导了这次采访研究，他说：“数学焦虑在很大程度上是一种情绪反应。年幼的孩子在上数学课的时候不会想去上学，他们会泪流满面，心烦意乱。“
"We had some young people saying: 'I get so frustrated, I end up hitting the desk,' and then they get themselves into bother. If we know what is at the bottom of the problem rather than addressing the symptoms we can address the root cause."
”我们有一些年轻人说：‘我太沮丧了，我最后会想要敲打桌子，’然后他们就麻烦了。”如果我们知道问题的根源是什么，而不是解决问题的表象，我们就可以解决问题的根源了。”
Researchers found there was a general sense that maths was hard compared with other subjects, which led to a loss of confidence, yet the study points out that most children with high levels of maths anxiety are normal to high achievers in the subject.
然而，研究指出，大多数数学焦虑程度高的孩子在这门学科中取得高分也是正常的。
Key triggers for anxiety included poor marks, test pressures, teasing by fellow pupils and a confusing mix of teaching methods. National Sats tests taken in the final year of primary school were a cause of anxiety for some, while the transition to secondary school was challenging for others.
引发焦虑的主要因素包括成绩不佳、考试压力、同学们的取笑以及各种教学方法的混淆。对一些人来说，小学最后一年参加的国家技能考试是一种焦虑的原因，而过渡到中学对另一些人来说则是一种挑战。
The children's emotional reactions included feelings of apprehension, tension, frustration or fear, while physical symptoms included butterflies, a racing heart or struggling to catch breath.
儿童的情绪反应包括恐惧、紧张、沮丧，而身体症状包括痉挛、心跳加速或呼吸困难。
"The experiences of maths anxiety are multifaceted, with students expressing emotions from rage to despair," the report says. "Students often reported overwhelming negative emotions which in some cases led them to act out in class and be removed from the classroom, or to become tearful. Others reported that they dreaded their mathematics lessons or that physical symptoms had an impact on their ability to flourish."
“数学焦虑的经历是多方面的，学生表达从愤怒到绝望的感情，”报告说明。“学生经常表达巨大的负面情绪，再一些案例里，她们会冲出课堂，被赶出教室，或者开始哭泣。另一些说到她们害怕数学课，或者身体症状影响她们的发展能力”。
It warns teachers and parents that their own anxieties about maths might have a negative influence and so urges them to tackle these first. It also urges policymakers to be conscious that emotional blocks can affect learning potential.
它警告教师和家长，他们自己对数学的焦虑可能会产生负面影响，因此敦促他们首先解决这些问题。它还敦促政策制定者意识到情绪障碍会影响学习潜力。
She's just six years old. But Suri Cruise looks like her teenage years have already begun.
The youngster was pictured organising her own playdates on a day out with her mother Katie Holmes in New York on Sunday.
她才6岁。但苏瑞.克鲁斯看起来像她的青少年时期已经开始了。小女孩被拍到上周日在纽约和她的母亲凯蒂?赫尔姆斯一起安排了她的童乐会一天约会。
As her mother sat patiently waiting, Suri slumped on a park bench making her calls. The youngster chatted away, a handbag slung over her body. But her bored expression was replaced by one of delight as the pair met up with another mother and child pair. Suri appeared thrilled with her friend, who could well be a new playmate from her school.
The pair walked in front of their mothers, chatting animatedly.
当她母亲坐那耐心等候时，苏芮坐在公园的长椅上打着电话。小女孩聊着天，一个包包斜跨在她身上。但当这对母女遇见另一对母子，她百无聊赖的表情很快被喜悦所代替。苏瑞似乎很兴奋见到她的朋友，那可能是她学校里的一个新玩伴。这对小孩走在他们母亲前面，热烈地聊着天。
Suri, dressed in pink, giggled shyly as her friend appeared to take down her number in his iPhone. Tom Cruise's daughter was pictured looking worried and anxious as she started school earlier this month. But it seems the initial nerves have been replaced by a busy new social life. She recently started at the elite $39,750-per-year Avenues school in New York as one of the first intake of 700 pupils.
苏瑞穿着粉红色，当她的朋友好像要在他的iPhone上记下她电话号码时，她羞涩地咯咯笑着。汤姆.克鲁斯的女儿被拍到这个月早些时候开始学校生活时她看起来很担心和焦虑，但似乎最初的紧张已被繁忙的新社交生活所代替。作为首批招收的700名儿童之一，她最近在每年39750美元学费的纽约精英国际学校就读。
Aimed at the children of the jetsetting elite 'The World School' enables pupils to follow their parents around the globe without being tied to school vacation schedules. It was initially reported that other parents were concerned Suri's presence could be disruptive, but it appears the youngster has settled in well.
针对那些有自家飞机的精英的孩子开办的“国际学校”能让孩子跟随父母去全球各地，而不局限于学校的假期安排。最初显示其他家长担心苏瑞的存在可能会有干扰，但小女孩似乎安顿得很好。
Still, that didn't stop her from scowling as she headed into school on Monday morning, no doubt upset her weekend was over.
不过，这并没有消除她周一早上去学校时的眉头紧皱，无疑烦恼她的周末已经结束了。
“You never get what you deserve; you only get what you negotiate.”
“你不会理所应当地获得你应该得到的，你只能获得你从谈判中争取到的。”
Lester Karrass, Negotiation Expert
——谈判专家莱斯特嘉洛斯
How many times have you heard someone complaining about another team member saying things like this:
你有多少次听到有人这样抱怨团队里的另一个成员：
“I made such a simple request…and they couldn’t deliver what I needed.”
“我只是提了一个很简单的要求……他们就是无法交付我需要的东西。”
“Every time I ask for something, they say ‘yes’ but I still don’t get what I need, when I need it.”
“每次我要什么东西，他们就说‘好的’，但是我还是不能在需要的时候得到需要的东西。”
“They just don’t seem to listen…there is always something they get wrong…don’t they know anything?”
“他们压根就没在听……他们总是能弄出差错……他们会什么？”
Or, perhaps, dear reader, you have found yourself saying something like the above when a team member’s performance is not what you expected?
或许，亲爱的读者，当一名团队成员的表现没有达到你的预期时，你自己也曾说过类似的话吧？
If you are honest, you can admit hearing things like this happen all the time…and sometimes it is your own performance that did not meet the standard and you end up feeling like a victim, yes?
如果你很诚恳，你可能会承认，你经常会听到这些话……有时甚至是你自己的表现没有达到标准，最后你感觉自己像个无助的受害者，是吧？
Why does this happen?Is it because people are stupid, lazy or incompetent. (If so I wonder how they got hired in the first place!) In 99% of cases, in my experience, the answer is “No.” The real problem is that both the person making the request and the person accepting it, are unskillful in making and accepting effective requests. It is not about ‘attitude’ it is about skill, and willingness to take the time to do what actually works.
那么，这种事情为什么会发生呢？是因为人们太笨、太懒、太无能吗？（如果是的话，我真怀疑他们一开始为什么会被录用！）根据我的经验，在99%的案例中，答案都是否定的。真正的问题是，无论提出要求的人也好，接受要求的人也罢，他们都不擅长有效地提出和接受别人的要求。因此这不是态度的问题，问题是你有没有技巧和意愿，去花时间做真正有效果的事。
If you want to solve this problem forever, it is time to start applying the SMART standard each and every time a request is negotiated. That’s right: negotiated. Each request is a negotiation, using SMART standards, to ensure that it will be carried out successfully the first time. If you have forgotten what “SMART” stands for, here it is again:
如果你想一劳永逸地解决这个问题，你就要在每次向别人提出要求时，在谈判过程中应用以下的“SMART”准则。你没听错，我用的是“谈判”这个词。每次提要求都是一次谈判，你要利用SMART准则，确保在第一时间成功地提出要求。如果你忘了“SMART”是什么意思，不妨在这里重温一下：
THE SMART STANDARD
SMART准则
SPECIFIC
具体
MEASURABLE
可衡量
ACTIONABLE
可执行
REALISTIC
现实性
TIME-BASED
时效性
1. Be Specific:Make sure your request is completely explicit and clear about exactly what is expected. Vagueness cannot be accepted. If a request is not clear to you, keep pushing until you know, specifically, what is wanted. When you are making the request, be CLEAR and say exactly what you want. Spell it out in black and white. You might spend 10 minutes writing down exactly what you want. That 10-minute investment may save you a lot of trouble later on.
1. 尽量具体（Specific）：确保你提出的要求明确细致地表达了你的期望。模糊不清是不能被接受的。如果你听不明白别人提出的要求，就要继续发问，一直到你彻底明白对方需要什么。在你向别人提要求的时候，要尽量明晰，直白地表达出你到底需要什么。你可以花十分钟把你需要的东西白纸黑字地写下来，这十分钟会给你后来的工作省去很多麻烦。
2. Make it Measurable.It must be clear how performance will be measured. What are the “success criteria” that will tell both parties when the desired outcomes have been achieved. Again, it must be spelled out in black and white. If not, expect breakdowns to occur. Always ask “how will you know, beyond any doubt, that this has been done to your satisfaction? What are your standards to measure this work?” If you don’t get this agreed between the two parties, expect trouble at the end of the road. Very often a person making a request is unclear about their own standards…until they see the other person’s work and it doesn’t meet them. Skillful leaders must learn to get clear about their standards so they can communicate them to others. If they don’t…who is being lazy? ?
2. 可衡量（Measurable）：双方都必须清楚对成果的衡量标准是什么。再次说明，这也得用白纸黑字写出来，否则就可能出现问题。经常问“你怎样知道这件事的成果让你满意？你衡量这项工作的标准是什么？”如果双方不就此达成一致，那么最后可能就会出现问题。通常提出要求的人自己也不清楚他们的标准，直到干活的人最后拿出了成果，他们才知道它不符合自己的标准。有技巧的领导必须学会划清标准，这样才能与其他人讨论标准问题。如果领导连标准都不划定……谁才是懒人呢？
3. Make it Actionable.The request must something that can be acted on. For example, it must be within our power, and we must have the necessary approvals, and the necessary budget and available manpower. Without such things, the request is not considered as “actionable.” If you feel, for any reason, that a request is no actionable…say so! If you suffer in silence and don’t push back, what do you think is going to happen? Speak up!
3. 可执行（Actionable）。这个要求必须是件可以执行的事。比如它必须在我们的能力范围以内，我们必须有必要的批准、必要的预算和必要的人手。没有这些东西，这个要求就不是“可执行”的要求。如果你不管出于任何考虑，都觉得一个要求不具备可行性，那你一定要说出来。如果你默默承受，没有据理力争，你觉得后果会变成什么样？所以一定要出说来！
4. Be Realistic.The request must allow sufficient time and there must be sufficient resources available. Asking someone to “re-build the Pyramids in 48 hours” is an example of a request that is not realistic. When a request seems to be un-realistic it is time to push back, say what is missing, and negotiate something you truly feel is realistic. If you need more time, ask for it. If someone says they need more time, give it to them. If the relevant resources are missing, provide them. How do you expect people to perform if they don’t have what they need?
4. 现实性（Realistic）。实现这个要求必须有充足的时间，并且可以调配充分的资源。让某人“在48小时内再建一座金字塔”就是不现实的要求。如果你觉得一个要求不现实，你应该把它推回给领导。你要告诉领导现在还缺少什么，以及怎样做才是现实的，并就此与他进行谈判。如果你需要更多时间，就提出要求。如果有人告诉你，他们需要更多时间，你就给他们时间。如果缺乏相关资源，就提供这些资源。巧妇难为无米之炊，缺乏必要的资源，他们能给出什么样的结果？
5. Make it Time-based.Both parties must agree on exactly how much time is going to be allowed to fulfill the request. If the time frame for completion is unclear, speak up! Push Back! Don’t say “yes” until you have a clear and acceptable time-frame to work with. Then agree on a specific time for delivery of the completed work. If there is not date and time of day on the calendar, it is not Time-based.
5. 时效性（Time-based）。双方必须在完成任务的时间上达成一致。如果完成时间不明确，就要说出来！据理力争！在得到一个清晰、可接受的时限之前不要说“好的”。在确定一个合理的成果交付时间后再表示同意。如果日历上没有明确的时间和日期，它就是一个不具有时效性的任务。
6. Check for Understanding.When negotiating a request, always check for understanding once you have clarified each element of the SMART standard. Do this by saying:
6. 检查对方的理解程度。为提要求而谈判时，一旦SMART准则的各个元素都明确之后，别忘了检查对方的理解程度。比如你可以说：
“Would you please repeat back to me what you have understood in this discussion? What is that you think we have agreed to? I just want to be very sure, for both our sakes, that we have got it right.”
“你能否向我重复一遍这次讨论结果的要点？你认为我们双方的协商结果是什么？我想确定我们双方都理解无误，这也是为了大家都好。”
As they speak, take notes and compare with your understanding. When they are finished, go back and clarify any points that did not match your understanding.
在对方说话时，记得做记录，并且与你自己的理解进行对比。等他们说完，再次就双方理解不一致的地方进行商榷。
After the conversation, send them a written memo or email that captures your agreement in black and white. Ask them to check it and confirm back to you. Once they agree that it is correct it is time to move into action…and not before. If you are the one accepting a request, write a quick email that summarizes each point of the SMART agreement you have just made. Ask the receiver to confirm that your understanding is correct.
谈话结束后，给他们发一份书面备忘录或电子邮件，使你们的口头同意变成白纸黑字。让他们细看一遍，然后给你发回确认信息。只有他们认同约定的内容都正确，这才算到了投入行动的时候。如果你是接受要求的那个人，那你可以迅速地写一封电邮，根据SMART准则，汇总双方谈判的所有要点，然后让对方确认你的理解是正确的。
What are the Benefits of Being SMART?
SMART准则的好处是什么？
Both parties greatly increase their confidence that the task is going to be effectively performed and delivered as expected. Everyone has much greater confidence in the outcomes.
双方都认为任务会得到有效执行，结果会达到预期。大家对结果也会有更大的信心。
Trust is increased between the two persons because breakdowns are avoided and they will be more willing to work as partners next time.
双方的信任感会提高，因为问题得到了有效避免，他们下次也会乐意再合作。
Using the SMART standard is a very simple and effective way to train and coach people. You are showing them what you expect them to do when it is their turn to make requests of others.
SMART准则是一个训练他人的非常简单有效的方法。通过言传身教，你可以让他们知道，当他们向别人提要求时应该怎么做。
Being SMART saves time and money by ensuring the task will be done right the first time.
SMART准则确保任务第一次就能正确完成，从而节省时间和金钱。
In my training workshops, and when I am coaching executives, I often ask people “Have you heard of the SMART standard?” The answer is most often ‘yes.’ But when I ask “Do you use it every time something important is at stake?” the answer is often ‘no.’ When I ask ‘why not?’ I hear things like:
在我的培训班里，当我给企业高管做培训时，我经常问他们：“你们听过SMART准则吗？”他们的回答经常是“是的。”但当我问道：“在办重要的事时，你们每次都会用到它吗？”答案往往是“不是。”当我又问“为什么”时，经常有人说：
It is so simple, I shouldn’t have to go to so much trouble.
任务很简单，没必要给自己找这种麻烦。
It takes too much time.
这样做花的时间太多了。
They should just know these things.
他们自然应该明白这些事情。
In the words of Tony Robbins, “Most people know what to do. They just don’t do what they know.” Does this apply to you?
用托尼罗宾斯的话说：“大多数人知道应该做什么，他们只是不做他们知道的事。”这话是不是也适用于你身上呢？
And, I have heard there are two Types of insanity:
另外，我还听说有两种“神经病”：
Type 1:Doing the same thing again and again, even though it is not working, and expecting to get a different result each time.
第一种：把一件事反复做了一遍又一遍，哪怕没有效果，还每次都期待着能获得不一样的结果。
Type 2:Stop doing something that you know works.
第二种：明明知道怎样做一件事有效，偏偏不那么做。
Which kind of insanity do you prefer?I suggest you avoid both kinds and start using the SMART standard. If you really want to be an effective leader, you must start being a SMART leader. You will gain respect and you will experience much greater confidence in getting the outcomes you need. And if you are on the receiving end…it’s time to speak up when you are unclear, stop pretending, and let people know what you need to be able to deliver.
你喜欢哪种“神经病？”我建议你两种都要避免，并且开始使用SMART准则。如果你真想成为一位有效的领导，就必须学会做一个SMART型领导。在这个过程中，你不仅会得到团队成员的尊重，也会获得更多信心。如果你是接受要求的一方，那么你就要在不明白的时候勇敢说出来，不要不懂装懂，让领导知道你需要他为你提供什么。
The majority of people are not stupid, or lazy or incompetent. And, the majority of people keep on making sloppy requests day in and day out, and still expect to get what they want. That is Type 1 insanity and you can avoid it by choosing to be SMART from now on.
大多数人都不笨，不懒，也不是无能之辈。但是大多数人每天都在提很糟糕的要求，而且还希望别人交付他们想要的东西。这就是所谓的“1型神经病”，坚持SMART准则，这是完全可以避免的。
Good luck and let me know how it’s working for you.
祝你好运，如果你觉得它有用，请让我知道。
China's factories held up in June after the country's official PMI index showed the manufacturing sector continued to expand for the fourth consecutive month.
6月份，中国的工厂又在运转了。此前，中国官方采购经理人指数(PMI)显示，中国制造业连续第4个月处于扩张之中。
The country's manufacturing purchasing managers' index was 50.2 in June, slightly below expectations of 50.4. It had also been 50.2 in May. Any level above 50 reflects growth and the sector last contracted in February.
6月份中国官方制造业PMI指数是50.2，略低于50.4的预期。该指数5月份读数也是50.2。PMI指数高于50，表示相关产业处于增长之中。中国的制造业最近一次收缩出现在今年2月。
Meanwhile China's services PMI reading for May was also over the point which separates growth from contraction, coming in at 53.8. It had been 53.2 in May, with readings of between 53 and 54 for 2015 so far.
此外，6月份中国服务业PMI读数为53.8，也高于50的荣枯线。相比之下，今年5月的服务业PMI读数为53.2,。2015年迄今，该读数一直在53到54之间。
China's economy grew at a 7 per cent year-on-year pace in the first quarter, the slowest rate of growth in six years. Chinese policymakers are now talking of the 'new normal' - a new period of slower growth - after the economy's dramatic expansion over the previous two decades.
今年第一季度中国经济同比增速为7%，是6年来的最慢增长速度。目前，在中国经济经历了过去20年的急剧增长之后，中国政策制定者正在提及“新常态”，即增长较为缓慢的新时期。
China's economy performed worse than expected in June, according to a closely-watched PMI survey compiled by HSBC, which indicated the country's manufacturing sector contracted more than first thought.
不过，由汇丰银行编制的制造业PMI指数要悲观一些。根据这一备受关注的指数，6月份中国经济状况弱于预期，该指数显示制造业的收缩状况比最初预料得严重。
HSBC's final manufacturing purchasing managers' index reading for June was 49.4, less than the original reading of 49.6 which economists had expected to be confirmed today. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector.
6月份汇丰银行制造业PMI指数的最终版读数为49.4，低于此前经济学家49.6的预期，表示制造业处于收缩之中。
The result stands in contrast to the official PMI reading, released an hour ago, which stated that the manufacturing sector had grown for the fourth consecutive month, with a reading of 50.2 in June.
这一读数和官方PMI读数出现了很大反差。不过，两者之间经常会出现略微不同步的现象，这通常是调查方法上的区别导致的。官方PMI调查侧重于规模较大的国有企业，而汇丰银行的调查样本要少得多，调查对象也集中于规模较小的民营企业。这种区别导致汇丰银行的PMI指数波动性比官方PMI指数更大一些。
Chinese consumer prices accelerated last month but the deflationary slump for producers deepened.
上个月中国消费品价格加速上涨。不过，生产商的通货紧缩却进一步加剧。
China's consumer price index ticked up to a year-on-year pace of 1.4 per cent in June, from 1.2 per cent in May, according to the government's official figures. That was just above the 1.3 per cent pace predicted by forecasters.
根据中国政府的官方数据，6月份中国居民消费价格指数同比上涨1.4%，略高于预测者给出的1.3%的涨幅。
The reading is nevertheless below Beijing's target of "around 3 per cent" this year.
不过，这一读数仍低于中国政府提出的今年令通胀率达到“3%左右”的目标。
"Consumer price inflation in China has reached the bottom of the cycle, but upward pressure remains minimal," said Moody's Analytics before the release. They added:“In the near term, inflation will remain low and stable on account of low input prices, such as for food and energy, and soft demand. Policy easing measures are enabling a rebound in housing and other sectors, and this should boost confidence and consumer spending over time, which should lead to a rebound in inflation.”
在数据发布之前，穆迪分析(Moody's Analytics)表示：“中国消费品价格指数(CPI)已到达周期底部，不过上行压力依然很小。”他们补充说：“在近期内，由于较低的输入价格（比如食品和能源的价格）和疲软的需求，通胀率将处于低位并保持稳定。政策性宽松举措正在为楼市和其他产业的反弹创造条件。随着时间的演变，这些举措应该会提振人们的信心，提升消费开支，从而令通胀率止跌回升。”
Producer prices, meanwhile, deflated for a 40th consecutive month, falling 4.8 per cent year on year. A month earlier the pace was -4.6 per cent.
与此同时，已连续下降40个月的工业生产者出厂价格，同比下跌了4.8%。相比之下，上个月的跌幅则为4.6%。
The sustained decline in producer prices reflects the downturn in China's housing market, which had led to excess supply of the materials used in the housing boom.
生产者价格指数的持续下跌，反映了中国楼市的低迷，这种低迷行情导致楼市繁荣时期用到的多种原料供应过剩。
Monthly passenger vehicle sales in China fell in June for the first time since June 2013, a bleak sign for the world's largest car market and second largest economy amid a stock market rout.
6月份，中国乘用车月销量出现2013年6月以来的首次下滑。在中国股市暴跌之际，这一结果为世界第一大汽车市场和第二大经济体的疲软提供了又一个证据。
Vehicle sales were 1,429,676 in June, down 3.2 per cent year-on-year, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
中国全国乘用车市场信息联席会(China Passenger Car Association)的数据显示，6月份，中国乘用车销量为1429676辆，同比减少3.2%。
Carmakers had already braced themselves for an era of slower growth amid a broader economic showdown in China, as well as an official clampdown on corruption and lavish shows of excess.
在中国整体经济放缓及官方打击腐败和炫富之际，中国汽车制造商已做好迎接增长放缓的准备。
But they could now be facing headwinds from a plummeting stock market, dominated by retail investors who could be left out of pocket.
但如今，股市暴跌给它们制造了新的困难。中国股市由散户主导，股市暴跌可能掏空了他们兜里的钱。
The steam started to go out of the Shanghai and Shenzhen indices around June 12, and they have both gyrated wildly in recent weeks.
6月12日前后，上证综指和深圳综指开始失去上涨动力。近几周来，两个指数都遭遇大幅回调。
Sales of passenger cars, SUVs and minivans increased 9.9 per cent year-on-year to 19.7m units in 2014, according to the Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers. The widely-watched CAAM monthly sales report will be released on Friday.
中国汽车工业协会（Chinese Association of Automobile Manufacturers，简称：中汽协）的数据显示，2014年中国轿车、运动型多用途车(SUV)和多功能乘用车(MPV)的销量为1970万辆，同比增长9.9%。备受关注的中汽协销量报告将于本周五公布。

We have all done it: a greasy pizza box, a disposable coffee cup, the odd plastic bag. Sometimes, we want things to be recyclable, so we put them in the recycling bin.
这种事我们都干过：沾满油污的披萨盒，一次性咖啡杯，多余的塑料袋。有时，我们希望这些东西能回收，于是把它们丢进了可回收垃圾箱。
Waste managers often call this wishful or aspirational recycling. But, unfortunately, putting these objects in with the rest of the recycling can do more harm than good. While rules differ in every municipality (check your local recycling website to find out what’s acceptable), we have picked out some key offenders to keep in mind.
垃圾管理公司经常把这种行为称为一厢情愿或热切盼望式回收。但是，不幸的是，把这些东西与其他可回收物放在一起弊大于利。虽然每个城市的规定各不相同（查看当地的垃圾回收网站，弄清哪些是可接受的），我们挑选了一些主要祸害，让大家记住。
Too many of these items will contaminate a batch of recycling. That means waste managers might not be able to find buyers for the materials — especially now that China, one of the world’s main importers of recyclable waste, has said it will reject shipments that are more than 0.5 percent impure. Contaminated loads could be sent to the landfill instead.
如果这种东西太多，会污染一批可回收物。那意味着，垃圾管理公司可能无法为这些材料找到买家，尤其是考虑到，主要的可回收垃圾进口国中国已表示，将拒绝接收不纯率在0.5%以上的垃圾。受到污染的可回收物可能会被送到垃圾填埋场。
Disposable cups
一次性杯子
Your disposable coffee cup might seem like it can be recycled, but most single-use cups are lined with a fine film of polyethylene, which makes the cups liquid-proof but also difficult and expensive to reprocess (because the materials have to be separated). Most waste management facilities will treat the cups as trash.
一次性咖啡杯看似可以回收利用，但大多数一次性杯子的内壁都有一层聚乙烯薄膜，那是为了让杯子防水，但对这层薄膜进行再加工十分困难，而且代价不菲（因为必须剥离这种材料）。大多数垃圾管理机构把这种杯子当作垃圾处理。
If you’re putting these cups in with your recycling, they are likely contaminating the rest of the materials, said Jim Ace, a senior campaigner at Stand.earth, an environmental group. In an experiment this year, the group affixed electronic trackers inside Starbucks cups, put the cups in recycling bins in Denver, then traced them to a landfill.
环保组织Stand.earth资深项目主任吉姆·埃斯(Jim Ace)表示，如果你把这些杯子和其他回收物放在一起，那么它们很有可能会污染其他东西。在今年的一项实验中，该组织在星巴克的杯子里贴上了电子追踪器，把杯子放入丹佛的可回收垃圾箱，最后在垃圾填埋场里追踪到了它们。
“There’s no way a consumer would know if a cup was lined,” Mr. Ace said, so it’s best to throw it away. (You can also check if your local recycler has special equipment to handle coffee cups; some do, a Starbucks spokeswoman said. The New York City Department of Sanitation says it accepts “paper cups with non-paper lining.”)
埃斯表示，“消费者不可能知道一个杯子是否有内衬”，所以最好把它扔掉（你也可以查一查当地的回收公司是否有专门处理咖啡杯的设备。星巴克的一位发言人表示，有些地方有。纽约市卫生部(The New York City Department of Sanitation)表示，它接受“带有非纸质内衬的纸杯”）。
The plastic lid might be recyclable in your area; check the number inside it against your local recycling guidelines.
在你生活的地区，塑料盖也许是可回收的。查看杯盖里的数字，与当地的回收指南比照。
Greasy pizza boxes
粘有油污的披萨盒
Pizza boxes are among the most common offenders when it comes to contamination, waste managers say. The problem is that oil often seeps into the cardboard. The oil cannot be separated from the fiber, making that material less valuable, and less marketable, to buyers.
垃圾管理公司表示，披萨盒是最常见的污染源。它的问题在于，油常常会渗入硬纸板。这种油无法与纤维分离，导致纤维的价值降低，更难出售。
But that’s not to say you can never recycle a pizza box, said Marjorie Griek, executive director of the National Recycling Coalition, which promotes recycling in the United States. “If you’ve got a few crumbs in there, that’s not an issue,” she said.
倡导垃圾回收的美国全国回收联盟(National Recycling Coalition)总干事玛乔丽·格里克(Marjorie Griek)表示，这并不是说，你绝不能把披萨盒丢入可回收垃圾箱。“如果里面只有一些面包屑，那不是问题，”她说。
Pizza boxes with “small amounts of grease” are O.K. to recycle in New York City, a sanitation department spokeswoman said. If the grease seeps through the cardboard, the box should be put in a composting bin or thrown out, she said.
纽约市卫生部的一位发言人表示，在纽约市，有“少量油脂”的披萨盒是可以回收的。她还表示，如果油脂渗进了纸板，那么应该放入堆肥垃圾箱，或者直接扔掉。
Remember, there are also two sides to a pizza box. If there’s a side that’s not oily, tear that off and recycle it.
请记住，披萨盒有两个面。如果有一面没有油脂，那么你可以把它撕下来回收。
Yogurt cups (and other non-recyclable plastics)
酸奶杯（以及其他不可回收塑料）
After China banned used plastics this year, many municipalities in the United States no longer accept plastics numbered 3 to 7, which can include things like yogurt cups, butter tubs and vegetable oil bottles. Look at the bottom of a container for a number inside a triangle to see what type it is.
在中国今年颁布了塑料废品禁令后，美国许多市政当局便不再接受3至7号塑料，这包括了诸如酸奶杯、黄油盒和植物油包装瓶一类。你可以查看容器底部写在三角形内的数字，看看它是哪类塑料。
Without China, there is little market for these types of plastic, said Will Posegate, chief operations officer for Garten Services, which manages waste in parts of Oregon. “It’s expensive to get rid of it right now,” he said.
佳腾服务公司(Garten Services)首席运营官威尔·波斯盖特(Will Posegate)说，没有了中国，这类塑料几乎没什么市场。该公司负责俄勒冈州部分地区的废品处理。“现在再去处理掉是很贵的，”他说。
Should you keep the caps on your bottles? Some waste managers say it’s fine (as long as they are screwed on tight), while others advise throwing them in the trash.
瓶盖该不该留在瓶子上？一些废品管理员表示这没问题（只要扭紧了就行），但也有人建议把瓶盖扔进垃圾箱。
Check your local recycling website to see which plastic types are still acceptable in your area.
你可以看看当地的回收网站，了解哪类塑料在你所在的地区仍可回收。
Oily takeout containers
有油污的外卖餐具
Even if a container is labeled correctly for recycling in your area, another contamination culprit is food residue: scraps of pad thai in a plastic tray, or those few drops of bad milk at the bottom of the jug.
即使某个容器在你所在的地区确实被划归为可回收一类，但食物残留也是一个污染源：剩在塑料盘里的泰式炒面，或者是罐底那几滴变质的牛奶。
Washing out food scraps from recyclables can be just as important as putting the right thing in the recycling bin, said Jackie Lang, a spokeswoman for Waste Management in Oregon. You don’t have to scrub containers until they are sparkling clean — that could waste water. But too many scraps of food and liquid can contaminate a load, which could then be sent to a landfill, Ms. Lang said. As much as possible, “keep food and liquids out,” she said.
俄勒冈州废物管理局(Waste Management)发言人杰姬·朗(Jackie Lang)表示，就和往回收箱内投入适合的物品一样，清洗掉可回收物品内的食物残留也同样重要。你不需要把容器擦洗得闪闪发亮——这会浪费水。但杰姬·朗说，过多的食物和液体残留会使一大批废品都收到污染，这会让它们被送往填埋场。尽可能“别混进食物和液体，”她说。
Plastic bags
塑料袋
If you have a trash chute in your building, or a long walk down to the recycling bin, you might have gotten into the habit of collecting your paper, plastics and glass in used plastic bags, but it’s important to note that the bags themselves should not be put in the recycling cart.
如果你的住房内设有垃圾滑槽，或者要走很久才有回收箱，你可能会养成把废纸、塑料、玻璃装在旧塑料袋中的习惯，但是记住重要的一点，塑料袋本身不应该被放入回收车中。
While we might wish that plastic bags — notorious for dissolving into microplastics and killing wildlife — could be sent to processors with our other recycling, they shouldn’t be. They create a nightmare for waste managers by plugging up machinery. So remember to dump your recyclables out of the plastic bag when putting them in the recycling bin. Some areas do offer plastic bag drop-offs, which send these nonrigid plastics to special facilities for recycling. Other cities and states have moved to tax, limit or ban the use of plastic bags altogether.
众所周知，塑料袋会分解成塑料微粒、杀死野生动物。尽管我们希望这些塑料袋会和我们其他的回收品一起被送往处理厂，但不应如此。它们会堵塞机器，变成废品管理员的噩梦。所以请记住，在把可回收物品放入回收箱时，不要和塑料袋一起扔进去。一些地区会提供塑料袋回收点，会将这些软性的塑料送往特殊的工厂进行回收。还有一些城市和州已经开始对所有塑料袋的使用进行收税、限制或禁止。
Dirty diapers (yes, people do this)
脏尿布（没错，有人这么做）
O.K., we’re not accusing you of attempting to recycle used diapers. But people out there are trying. Waste managers around the United States say they turn up at their recycling facilities often.
好吧，我们没有因为你想回收脏尿布而指责你，但有人企图这么做来着。美国各地的废品管理机构表示，回收设备里常常会有脏尿布出现。
In some cases, people might think that a diaper should be recyclable because it is mostly made of plastic, said Garry Penning, a spokesman for Rogue Disposal and Recycling, which operates throughout Oregon. But diapers are made of a number of materials, and usually more than one type of plastic. Of course, once they are used, they are also filled with human waste.
业务遍布俄勒冈州的罗格处理回收公司(Rogue Disposal and Recycling)的发言人加里·潘宁(Garry Penning)表示，有些时候，人们可能会认为尿布应该是可回收的，因为它主要由塑料制成。但构成尿布的材料有好几种，塑料通常也不止一种。当然了，一旦被使用，尿布也会沾满人类排泄物。
In other cases, Mr. Penning said, the recycling bin has simply become “the overflow for the garbage pail.” While there have been some attempts at diaper recycling, for the most part dirty one-use diapers are not considered recyclable and are best put straight in the trash.
潘宁说，有时候回收箱直接就变成了“垃圾桶满了以后的去处”。尽管有人尝试对尿布进行回收，但在大多数情况下，一次性尿布是不可回收的，最好把它们直接扔进垃圾箱里。
“As a result of China’s waste import restrictions, we need to educate the public how to recycle properly,” said David Biderman, executive director of the Solid Waste Association of North America. “I think the public can make a significant difference,” he said.
“中国限制垃圾进口的结果就是，我们需要教育公众如何正确回收垃圾了，”北美固体废弃物协会(Solid Waste Association of North America)总干事戴维·比德曼(David Biderman)说。“我认为公众是可以发挥很大作用的，”他说。
To succeed you must stand out from the crowd. Here are six ways:
想要成功，你必须要出类拔萃。这里有六种方法：
1.Be first with a purpose.
1.首要的一点是要有目的性。
Lots of employees, managers, and business owners are the first to arrive each day. That's great, but what do you do with that time? Organize your thoughts? Get a jump on your email?
很多员工、经理和老板都是每天第一个到公司的。这一点很好，但你在那段时间里都做了什么呢？梳理你的想法吗？浏览你的电子邮件？
Instead of taking care of your stuff, do something visibly worthwhile for the company. Take care of unresolved problems from the day before. Set things up so it's easier for employees to hit the ground running when they come in.
做一些对公司有明显价值的事情，而不是关注你自己的事。处理好前一天尚未解决的问题。制定好标准，因而当其他员工进来时，他们落实操作就容易得多了。
Don't just be the one who turns on or off the lights – be the one who gets in early or stays late in order to get things done. Not only will your performance stand out, you'll also start to...
不只是做一个开灯或关灯的人——为了把事情做好，做一个早到或晚走的人。那样你不仅能脱颖而出，而且你也开始……
2.Be known for something specific.
2.以具体才能而闻名
Meeting standards, however lofty those standards may be, won't help you stand out.
如果只是按要求完成任务，无论要求有多高，你都不会脱颖而出。
So go above the norm. Be the leader known for turning around struggling employees. Be the owner who makes a few deliveries a week to personally check in with customers. Be the manager who consistently promotes from within. Be known as the employee who responds quicker, acts faster, or always follows up.
所以要做到高于标准。做领导，要能为员工排忧解难。当老板，即使一周要出货几次也要亲力亲为为客户验货。当经理，要懂得总是从内部提拔。做员工，要反应敏捷、行动快速、紧跟领导。
Pick a worthwhile mission, then excel at that mission. People will notice.
选择一个值得去做的任务，然后优秀地执行任务。你做过的成绩别人都看在眼里。
3.Create your own side project.
3.创建自己的副项目。
Excelling at an assigned project is expected. Excelling at a side project helps you stand out.
优秀地完成指定的项目是你应该做的。优秀地完成一个副项目则能帮你脱颖而出。
For example, years ago I decided to create a Web-based employee handbook my then-employer could put on the company Intranet. I worked on it at home on my own time. Some managers liked it but the HR manager didn’t so it died an inglorious death.
例如，几年前我决定创建一份基于网络的员工手册，这样的话我那时的雇主可以将它放在公司内部网上。我在家里利用休息的时间做这件事。有些经理喜欢，但是人力资源经理不喜欢，于是这份手册悲剧地被闲置在了一边。
I was disappointed, but the company wasn't "out" anything, and soon after I was selected for a high visibility company-wide process improvement team because my little project made me "that guy."
我很失望，但是公司并没有那么“出格”，不久后，我因深刻的洞察力被选为全公司范围内的过程改进团队，因为我的小项目，我才成为“其中一员”。
The same applies for a business owner. Experiment on a new process or service with a particular customer in mind. The customer will appreciate how you tried, without being asked, to better meet their needs, and your business will become "that business."
这同样适用于一个公司的老板。脑子里想着要为某一特殊客户提供一种新的方法或服务的实验。客户会感谢你做出的努力，不用询问，更好地满足他们的需求，你的生意将会成为“那种生意”.
4.Put your muscle where your mouth is.
4.用事实说话。
Lots of people take verbal stands. Few take a stand and put effort behind their opinions.
很多人有口头之勇。很少有人会独树一帜，并为他们的想法付出努力。
Say you think a project has gone off the rails; instead of just pointing out its flaws so you can show everyone how smart you are, jump in and help fix it. Everyone talks about problems. The people who help fix them stand out.
比如说你觉得有一个项目出了岔子，那就投入进去并且帮助解决它，而不是指出它的缺点以此向所有人显示你有多聪明。每个人都在谈论问题。那些能帮助处理问题的人才会脱颖而出。
5.Show a little of your personal side.
5.展现一点点你个人的一面
Personal interests help other people to identify and remember you. That's a huge advantage for a new employee or a company competing in a crowded market.
个人的兴趣能帮助其他人认同并且记住你。对于新员工或是一家处于激烈的市场竞争中的公司来说，这是一项巨大的优势。
Just make sure your personal interests don't overshadow professional accomplishments. Let people know a little about you; a few personal details add color and depth to your professional image.
只要确保你的个人兴趣不会夺去事业成就的光彩。让人们对你有所了解，比如为你的专业形象添加色彩和深度的一些个人细节。
6.Work harder than everyone else.
6.比其他人更努力地工作。
Nothing – nothing – is a substitute for hard work. Look around: How many people are working as hard as they can? Very few.
没有什么——没有什么是努力工作的代替品。环顾四周：有多少人在尽他们所能用心工作？几乎没有。
The best way to stand out is to out-work everyone else.
脱颖而出的最好方法是比其他人工作突出。
It's also the easiest way, because you'll be the only one trying.
这也是最简单的方式，因为你是唯一一个在尝试的人。
Although we may never know why we didn't get chosen for a job interview, a recent study is shedding some light on recruiters' decision-making behavior. According to TheLadders research, recruiters spend an average of "six seconds before they make the initial 'fit or no fit' decision" on candidates.
尽管我们可能永远不会知道为什么我们会被选中去参加面试，但最近的一项研究却阐明了招聘者的决策行为。根据TheLadders（求职网站）的研究，招聘者平均会花6秒的时间对候选人作出初步的“合不合适”的判断。
The study used a scientific technique called “eye tracking” on 30 professional recruiters and examined their eye movements during a 10-week period to "record and analyze where and how long someone focuses when digesting a piece of information or completing a task."
这项研究使用了一种称为“眼球追踪”的科技，观察了在10周时间内30名专业招聘人员的眼球运动，以此来“纪录并分析当一个人查看一份信息或者完成一项工作时他会关注于哪些地方”。
In the short time that they spend with your resume, the study showed recruiters will look at your name, current title and company, current position start and end dates, previous title and company, previous position start and end dates, and education.
研究表明，在招聘者把眼神停留在你简历上的那段短暂的时间里，他们会看你的名字、当前头衔和公司、当前职位的起讫时间、前头衔和公司、前职位的起讫时间，以及教育经历。
With such critical time constraints, you should make it easier for recruiters to find pertinent information by creating a resume with a clear visual hierarchy and don't include distracting visuals since "such visual elements reduced recruiters’ analytical capability and hampered decision-making" and kept them from "locating the most relevant information, like skills and experience."
在如此有限的时间里，你必须尽量让简历具有清晰的视觉层次，而不是复杂的视觉效果，以此来使招聘者能更快地找到相关信息。因为“复杂的视觉元素降低了招聘者的分析能力，并阻碍了决策”，也妨碍了他们“找到最相关的信息，比如技能和工作经验”。
Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have ended their acrimonious divorce battle, reaching a settlement for Heard to receive $7 million and drop her case.
约翰尼·德普和艾梅柏·希尔德终于结束了这场腥风血雨的离婚战，他们达成离婚协议，希尔德将获得700万美元的赡养费并撤回诉讼。
Amber Heard is giving away every penny from the $7 million divorce settlement she got from Johnny Depp to charities that help battered women and sick children.
艾梅柏·希尔德将700万赡养费全部捐献给了帮助受虐待妇女和患病儿童的慈善机构。
Heard, 30, told TMZ she is donating the money to both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, where she says she has worked as a volunteer for 10 years. The money will divided equally between the two charities.
30岁的艾梅柏·希尔德告诉娱乐新闻网站TMZ，她将把赡养费捐给美国公民自由联盟和洛杉矶儿童医院，她说自己曾为这家医院当了10年志愿者。赡养费将平分给两家机构。
It seems that a buoyant Amber Heard was ready to put the acrimonious end of her marriage behind her, as she joined her A-List pals Margot Robbie and Cara Delevinge for a fun-filled evening out in London,on Friday, 22 August 2016.
艾梅柏·希尔德似乎已经将她这场腥风血雨的离婚战抛之脑后，8月22日周五，她和她的好朋友玛歌特·罗比和卡拉·迪瓦伊在伦敦度过了充满乐趣一晚。
A weight off her shoulders? Laughing and japing around with her girl friends after dinner, the Driver Angry star didn't bother to make a Hollywood exit from the popular eatery; choosing instead to mingle with her friends on the pavement
如释重负？晚饭过后她的女性朋友不停的说笑，这名《狂暴飞车》明星从餐馆出来并没有用好莱坞的退场方式，而是选择在人行道上和她的朋友打成一片。
The stars were all smiles as they said goodbye to some of their friends after the meal, with Margot looking particularly up-beat.
用餐后明星们都满脸笑容的跟他们的朋友们告别，玛歌特·罗比看起来特别开心。
The script for Amazon's new Lord Of The Rings series is so heavily-guarded that its locked in a windowless room that requires fingerprint access to enter.
亚马逊翻拍的新指环王的剧本被严密坚守，不仅被锁在一个没有窗户的房间里，还需要指纹识别才可以进入。
Amazon Chief Jennifer Salke was speaking with The Hollywood Reporter about the online giant's future plans for its content when she revealed the measures used to keep the show's storyline a secret on Wednesday.
周三，亚马逊总监Jennifer Salke在接受《好莱坞记者报》采访时候，谈到这家网络公司未来内容的发展计划，揭露了公司是用什么方法帮剧本保密的。
When asked if she could tell readers anything about the $1 billion TV adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's novels, she said: 'There's a fantastic writers room working under lock and key. They're already generating really exciting material.
这部亚马逊斥资10亿美金的电视剧改编自约翰·罗纳德·瑞尔·托尔金的小说。在被问及可否向读者透露剧本的内容时，她说：“我们有一个非常好的写作室，里面已经有了非常激动人心的素材，而且这个写作室在严密的监控之下。
'And there's a security guard that sits outside, and you have to have a fingerprint to get in there.'
“保安坐在写作室外，你需要指纹才能进入。”
While little is known about Amazon's Lord Of The Rings TV show, rumours are swirling that the fantasy spin-off will centre around the life of Aragorn, played in the films by Viggo Mortensen.
虽然外界对亚马逊要拍摄的《指环王》电视剧知之甚少，不过有流言称，这部衍生剧会主要围绕阿拉贡这一人物的生平来写，之前电影中该角色是由维果·莫特森来扮演的。
Dedicated fans of the J.R.R Tolkien series believe that the series will mainly focus on the Ranger Of The North
指环王系列的忠粉们认为该故事主要围绕北方游侠来开展。
In a series of highly-detailed tweets, the fan base highlighted that Tolkien's mammoth back-catalogue of different stories and appendices will give Amazon extensive material to work with.
在一系列有具体细节的推文中，粉丝们指出，托尔金的唱片小说是基于很多不同的故事，书中的附录也给亚马逊提供了不少可以进一步探索的延伸素材。
After confirming from 'multiple sources' that Aragorn will take centre stage on the show, the fansite tweeted: 'From the first press release, we know this so-called #LOTR series will NOT be a retelling of the events of the War of the Ring.
'在经过“多方来源”的肯定下，阿拉贡将会成为这个电视剧的主角，粉丝网站发推问：“从第一次发布会开始，我们就知道这部指环王系列电视剧不会成为仅仅复述电影中的内容。”
'Instead it will be Appendices based and cover a lot of time and history. This is the greatest advantage the show runners have: that so much of Tolkien's storytelling, even just in 'Appendix A,' covers a tremendous swath of time.
这会成为一部索引时间跨度长，涵盖历史广。对于拍摄电视剧来说是一个大优势：托尔金的故事太长了，附录A就已经涉及了很长的时间。“
Amazon has been given a multi-season order to the series, which was confirmed in November last year.
去年11月分亚马逊就确认该系列会拍摄好几季。
Social media in China has been buzzing following the release of a video showing passengers coming together, along with staff, to help leverage a subway car off a woman's leg in Guangzhou.
近日，广州地铁内的乘客与站内工作人员协力将地铁推开，成功拔出一名女乘客的腿的视频，在中国的社交媒体上得到广泛关注。
The 72-year-old woman's leg became wedged in the gap between the carriage and the platform on subway line-6 in Guangzhou, May 6, 2017.

KANPUR: Swimming wonder Shraddha Shukla, popularly known as ‘Nanhi Jalpari’, will spread her ‘clean Ganga’ message by covering 550-km distance between Kanpur and Varanasi in 70 hours.
为了呼吁大家保持恒河的干净，游泳奇人沙得拉舒克拉打算花70个小时游完550公里。
The girl, who took a plunge in the Ganga near Massacre Ghat in Kanpur on the eve of National Sports Day (August 29), is likely to reach Varanasi on the tenth day. On an average, she will swim seven hours per day.
8月29日，也就是全国体育日那一天前夕，沙得拉跳入恒河，可能要第10天才能游到瓦拉纳西。平均来说，她每天要游7小时。
The 11-year-old started her journey into the swollen Ganga, with her inspirational message of ‘making the river clean’, amid ‘puja’ rituals and the chanting of ‘mantras’, and headed for Varanasi via Allahabad to cover 550 km in 10 days, here on Sunday morning.
11岁女孩游恒河，是为了传达“保持河流清洁”的信息。准备花10天从阿拉哈巴德游到瓦拉纳西，全程550公里。
“I am really very excited and ready to better me previous performances. I am sure that I will complete the challenge,” said Shraddha, brimming with confidence.
沙得拉自信满满地说，“我真的很激动，有信心超过之前的表现。我确信自己能完成挑战的。”
The 1970s is achingly cool once again. In the world of fashion, Saint Laurent and Gucci are riding the crest of the 70s-inspired look.
上世纪70年代的流行风格再度成为时尚宠儿，圣罗兰(Saint Laurent)与古驰(Gucci)是这股复古之风的引领者。
And the world of jewellery is cashing in on the trend for nostalgia, albeit nostalgia only a few decades old.
尽管只是怀旧几十年前的流行时尚，但珠宝首饰界却乘势利用这股复古之风大获其利。
In 2007, Daphne Lingon, senior vice-president of jewellery at Christie’s New York, identified what would be the next big thing in the market. She won a surprisingly hard-fought bidding battle for a pair of 1970s David Webb gold and white enamel ear pendants for an unidentified high-profile client for the world of fashion.
早在2007年，纽约佳士得(Christie)首饰拍卖部副总裁达芙妮霠Ⅷ(Daphne Lingon)就已经对未来的珠宝潮流未卜先知。她曾代表一位未透露姓名的时尚名流，在一场惊心动魄的竞标大战中，出人意料地拍到了大卫韦伯(David Webb)上世纪70年代用黄金与白珐琅打造的一对耳坠。
Today, her instinct has proved accurate as the market for 1970s jewellery flourishes. Yet despite this, according to Ms Lingon: “We don’t have enough [1970s] pieces for demand.”
今天，随着上世纪70年代的首饰行情火爆，证明她当初的直觉完全正确。然而尽管如此，林贡说：“我们目前的‘存货’供不应求。”
Prices are climbing, more pieces are on the market and estimates are being smashed. A simple Bulgari gold chain necklace went for $25,000 — five times its estimate — at a sale in April held at Sotheby’s New York.
这些上世纪70年代的首饰售价正不断攀升，而更多类似物件正源源不断进入交易市场，先前的预估价不断被刷新。在今年四月举行的纽约苏富比(Sotheby)拍卖会上，一件造型简单的宝格丽金项链最终以2.5万美元成交——比预估价足足高出了4倍。
Frank Everett, sales director of jewellery at Sotheby’s New York, says: “People collecting jewellery in the 1970s are now in their 80s and 90s and are selling now. And there are more estates with 1970s pieces.”
纽约苏富比首饰拍卖主管弗兰克埃弗雷特(Frank Everett)说：“上世纪70年代首饰的那些收藏者如今已届耄耋之年，他们开始出手这些藏品；更多人家里还收藏有上世纪70年代的物件。”
He cites two big private collections in the company’s forthcoming December sale as an example, including an 18-carat gold and carved jade David Webb necklace with detachable pendant estimated at $80,000-$120,000.
他以纽约苏富比12月拍卖会上竞拍的两件私人收藏的精品为例加以说明，其中之一就是由大卫韦伯打造的一款镶嵌18克拉黄金与玉雕件、搭配可卸式挂件的项链，预估价为8-10万美元。
Fashion has shown jewellery the way. Hedi Slimane, creative director of Saint Laurent (which made its name in the 1970s) has doubled the brand’s sales revenue from 353m in 2011 to 707m in 2014, thanks to his sellout 1970s rock ’n’ roll collections.
时尚界已为珠宝首饰指明了未来发展方向。正是由于圣罗兰（上世纪70年代创建品牌）创意总监艾迪斯理曼(Hedi Slimane)设计的上世纪70年代摇滚风格的首饰系列一款难求，公司销售额从2011年的3.53亿欧元飚升至2014年的7.07亿欧元。
And now there is Gucci’s new creative director, Alessandro Michele, who has overhauled the company — and influenced the industry — with his heavily 1970s-inspired debut collections, which have helped reinvigorate the brand. In July, Gucci announced a 4.6 per cent jump in second-quarter sales, after a 7.9 per cent drop in first-quarter sales.
另一紧跟这股潮流的代表人物是古驰新任创意总监亚历桑德罗猠歇尔(Alessandro Michele)，他让古驰风格发生了脱胎换骨的变化，正是他深受上世纪70年代时尚风格启发而推出的首场时装系列让古驰品牌重现辉煌，进而深刻影响了整个时尚界。今年七月，古驰宣布第二季增收4.6%，从而与首季营收减少7.9%形成了鲜明对比。
“Everyone loves the 1970s and the idea of being so cool yet so laid back,” says Justin O’Shea, buying director for luxury e-retailer Mytheresa.com. “The 1970s spirit is unbridled and it provides a feeling of pure happiness, which resonates with the end consumer, whether fashion or high jewellery.”
“大家都喜欢上世纪70年代的时尚风格，它显得既新潮又休闲。”奢侈品线上零售网Mytheresa.com采购总监贾斯汀攠谢(Justin O’Shea)说。“上世纪70年代崇尚天马行空的时尚风格，它提供的是纯粹的快乐感，不管是时装还是高档首饰，都深受终端消费者的青睐。”
While 1970s jewellery by Bulgari, David Webb, Van Cleef & Arpels and other big names make the highest prices, the market for independent 1970s designers such as Andrew Grima and John Donald is growing, too.
虽说宝格丽(Bulgari)、大卫韦伯以及梵克雅宝(Van Cleef & Arpels)等知名品牌推出的上世纪70年代时尚风格的首饰市场售价最高，但安德鲁格里马(Andrew Grima)以及约翰唐纳德(John Donald)等上世纪70年代独立设计师同样越来越受到市场追捧。
Indeed, according to Daniel Struyf, Bonhams’ new international jewellery director, there was more craftsmanship in 1970s jewellery than in today’s pieces. Little wonder a Grima grey-blue sapphire and diamond square-cut ring in Bonhams’ fine jewellery sale in London next month is estimated at 500,000- 700,000.
没错，在邦瀚斯拍卖行(Bonhams)新任国际珠宝总监丹尼尔斯特鲁伊夫(Daniel Struyf)看来，相比如今的珠宝首饰，上世纪70年代的物件多由手工打造。由格里马打造的一款镶嵌蓝宝石与钻石、方形切割而成的蓝灰色戒指在下月的邦瀚斯伦敦名贵首饰拍卖会上预估价高达50万-70万英镑也就不足为奇了。
London gallerist Louisa Guinness, who launched LG Treasures in May focusing on rare 1970s (and 1960s) jewels, says these pieces have widened the pool of traditional jewellery collectors. “The designs are mini artworks so they appeal to collectors who like design rather than rocks or gold,” she says.
伦敦画廊经营者路易莎吉尼斯(Louisa Guinness)于今年五月举办了LG Treasures，专门展出上世纪70年代（以及60年代）的珍稀款首饰。她说这些展品拓宽了传统首饰藏家的收藏范围。“这些精品犹如微型艺术珍品，深受痴迷设计风格而非宝石或黄金本身藏家之青睐。”她说。
More women in their 30s to 50s are purchasing these pieces, too — to wear as well as invest. Catherine McKenna, co-founder of fine antique and period jewellers McKenna & Co, says: “They want an exclusive piece like a Kutchinsky instead of the same Rolex as everyone else.”
更多30岁至50岁之间的女性也开始买入这类首饰，既是投资工具，也作穿戴之用。凯瑟琳麦肯纳(Catherine McKenna)是老款珠宝首饰名品公司McKenna & Co的联合创始人，她说：“藏家希望拥有一款限量版的辜青斯基首饰（Kutchinsky，一个源自波兰的古老珠宝品牌，距今已有一个多世纪的历史，设计极为精美，以工艺繁复著称），而不是大同小异的劳力士腕表。”
According to Jon King, senior vice-president of product and store design at Tiffany & Co, the yellow gold that characterises 1970s jewellery makes it today’s canny investment, thanks to a better understanding of assets and investments. Tiffany has recently plundered its design archive for the first time, using its 1970s Blue Book catalogue for an eight-piece capsule collection with Dover Street Market including diamond and tsavorite gold earrings adapted from a 1973 cufflinks and stud set. “The 1970s broadens our international appeal,” says Mr King.
蒂芙尼负责产品与门店设计的执行副总裁乔恩金(Jon King)说，用金银铜合金材料打造的上世纪70年代首饰如今成了投资宠儿，这都归功于对资产以及投资理念的深刻理解。蒂芙尼最近首次大规模逆袭留存的设计档案——它从上世纪70年代的Blue Book高级珠宝目录中汲取灵感，与时尚概念店丹佛街集市(Dover Street Market)合作推出了八件套的混搭系列首饰(capsule collection)，其中就包括一款镶嵌钻石与沙弗来石的金耳环，它改自1973年的一套袖扣与纽扣。“上世纪70年代风格的首饰提升了我们品牌的国际知名度。”乔恩金说。
“Nineteen seventies jewellery is still relatively inexpensive compared to other popular periods such as Art Deco or Georgian,” says Sam Loxton, manager of Lucas Rarities, a London-based jeweller specialising in the 1910s to the 1970s, who spoke on 1970s jewellery at September’s Lapada art and antiques fair. “Prices [for 1970s pieces] tend to be under 50,000, while I sold a Cartier Art Deco diamond sautoir for 125,000 at Art Antiques London in June and a pair of Georgian diamond drop earrings for 145,000 in July,” he says.
“与阿泰科风格(Art Deco)以及英王乔治时代风格(Georgian)其它知名时期相比，上世纪70年代的珠宝首饰价位仍然较低。”Lucas Rarities经理山姆洛克斯顿(Sam Loxton)说，该店是伦敦专营20世纪初至70年代风格的珠宝零售店。在今年九月举行的Lapada艺术与古玩博览会上，他这样评价上世纪70年代的珠宝首饰。“这个时代的首饰售价往往不到5万英镑，而在今年6月与7月举办的伦敦艺术古董展(Art Antiques London)上，卡地亚(Cartier)一款阿泰科风格的钻石项饰以及乔治王时期风格的一副钻石耳坠分别卖了12.5万英镑与14.5万英镑的高价。”他说。
Cristina Miller, North American head of dealer relations at online marketplace 1stdibs, says the high visibility of 1970s jewellery online is fuelling the market — whether on its website or the auction house e-catalogue.
奢侈品购物网1stdibs北美地区经销商主管克里斯蒂娜猠勒(Cristina Miller)说：不管是在自家网站、还是在拍卖行的电子目录上亮相，上世纪70年代风格首饰的高曝光率让珠宝首饰的行情更加火爆。
“The big, bold designs and unmissable yellow gold are easier to see online than say the intricate Art Deco looks which are harder to see even with a zoom,” she says.
“在网店上，设计大胆的大物件首饰以及消费者不应错过的金银铜合金材质首饰在网店上比比皆是，而做工精巧的阿泰科风格首饰即便出高价也是难觅踪迹。”她说。
The deep-pocketed big brands are also driving the market as they buy back their archive to showcase in retrospectives and bolster their collections.
财大气粗的知名首饰品牌通过回购自己以前推出的老款式举办回顾展以提升自己品牌知名度，从而再助首饰火爆行情以一臂之力。
Van Cleef & Arpels is hoovering up its 1970s pieces as “if I wait I won’t find anything on the second-hand market”, says Catherine Cariou, the company’s heritage director. And Bulgari is showcasing its first coin collections, multi-gem sautoirs and other 1970s pieces in its Art of Bulgari show at the Tokyo National Museum.
梵克雅宝大量回购自己上世纪70年代推出的首饰款式，给人的感觉是：“自己在二手市场不果断出手，就会一无所获”。其传承典藏总监凯瑟琳愠里乌(Catherine Cariou)说。宝格丽在东京国立博物馆(Tokyo National Museum)举办了“宝格丽的艺术展”(Art of Bulgari show)，展出了自己推出的首个纪念币系列、镶嵌多颗宝石的项饰以及其它上世纪70年代的各款首饰。
“Everywhere we expose the brand, we show these [1970s] pieces to bring desirability to the brand and to convince clients to go for a high jewellery piece, particularly those clients from China and south east Asia” says Vincent Reynes, Bulgari’s UK managing director.
“不管在哪儿举办展会，我们都会展示这些上世纪70年代的首饰，以增加品牌满意度，并且成功说服消费者购置高档首饰，尤其是那些来自中国以及东南亚的客户。“宝格丽英国区总经理文森特雷恩斯(Vincent Reynes)说。
With the 1970s look still vibrating across the spring/summer 2016 catwalks, boho jewels look set for a glittering future.
上世纪70年代风格的首饰仍在各大时装品牌2016年春夏季展中大放异彩，波希米亚风格的首饰前景注定是一片光明。
The Queen's last corgi, a 12-year-old called Whisper, has died following several weeks of illness.
女王的最后一只柯基，12岁大的Whisper在病了几周以后死了。
The monarch adopted the dog two years ago after his owner, former Sandringham gamekeeper Bill Fenwick, passed away.
这只狗原来的主人前桑德林厄姆守门员Bill Fenwick去世以后，女王收养了这只狗两年多。
According to the Daily Mail, the corgi died last week at Windsor Castle, leaving the Queen "deeply saddened".
根据《每日邮报》的报道，上周这只柯基在温莎堡的离世，让女王悲痛万分。
"Whisper was a friendly chap and followed her everywhere," a source said.
知情人说，“Whisper 是一个友善的小家伙，总是跟着女王到东到西。”
"The Queen has quickly become very attached to the dog."
“女王也很快依赖上了这只小狗。”
The Queen still has two dorgis called Candy and Vulcan, who are crossbreeds between daschunds and corgis.
女王还有两只柯基叫Candy和Vulcan，是腊肠和柯基的杂交。
She received her first corgi as a gift on her 18th birthday, who she named Susan.
女王18岁生日的时候，收到的礼物就是她人生中第一只柯基，它的名字叫Susan。
The Queen has owned more than 30 corgis since she became Queen of the United Kingdom in 1952, with all of them apart from Whisper related to Susan.
1952年，她成为英国女王之后，她陆续有了30多只柯基，除了Whisper其他都是Susan的子嗣。
In April this year, the last of the Queen's royal corgis that could trace its lineage back to Susan passed away.
今年四月，女王的最后一只Suasan的子孙死了。
The Pembroke Welsh Corgi has an average lifespan of 11 to 13 years, explains Pet Health and Pet Nutrition Information.
根据宠物健康与宠物营养信息机构表示， 彭布罗克威尔士柯基的平均寿命是11到13年。
The new owner of what Christie’s auction house called the largest and most perfect briolette diamond ever sold at auction has identified herself and picked a name for the 75.36-carat gem.
一颗重达75.36克拉的巨钻找到了新主人，并得到了新名字。据佳士得拍卖行所称，这颗钻石是有史以来上拍的最大、最完美的水滴形钻石。
Tiffany Chen, vice chairman of China Star Entertainment Ltd., has revealed herself to be the owner of the briolette diamond. She named the diamond after her company, “The Star of China.”
中国星娱乐有限公司（China Star Entertainment Ltd.）副主席陈明英（Tiffany Chen）已经透露她是这颗钻石的新主人。她以自己公司的名称为这枚钻石命名为“中国之星。”
Chen purchased the diamond May 28 at Christie’s Hong Kong Magnificent Jewels sale for more than $11.15 million, $148, 000 per carat, a world record for a briolette diamond sold at auction.
5月28日，陈明英在佳士得香港举办的珠宝拍卖会上以1115万美的天价成交，平均每克拉14.8万美元，成为拍卖史上价格最昂贵的水滴形钻石。
The briolette has been graded by the Gemological Institute of America to be of D color and type IIa, indicating its internally flawless clarity, excellent polish, highest level of chemical purity and exceptional optical transparency. Less than one carat in every 100, 000 carats of diamonds is found to be found in this perfect condition.
这颗水滴形钻石已经被美国宝石学院鉴定为“D色”和“type IIa”级，这意味着它的内部毫无瑕疵、切工完美，化学纯度达到顶级，并有着极佳的光学透明度。每10万克拉的钻石中，符合这种完美条件的钻石不足1克拉。
The diamond is part of a pendant necklace that includes a marquise-cut purplish pink diamond suspended above the briolette.
这颗钻石被作为一条项链的吊坠，在巨钻上方还悬吊着一枚橄榄形粉钻。
When Superman returns to the big screen on June 14 as the star of 'Man of Steel, ' he'll be doing a lot of heavy lifting for a character who turned 75 this year. Untold legions of Superman fans spanning both the continents and the decades can rattle off his celebrated 'powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men': super strength, super speed, super vision, and the ability to fly. But not least among his more amazing powers has been a superhuman charisma and ever-enduring appeal.
当超人在6月14日作为《钢铁之躯》(Man of Steel)主角回归大屏幕的时候，作为一个今年年满75岁的角色，他将面临艰巨的任务。各大洲几十年来数不清的超人迷都可以不假思索地说出他世人皆知的“远超肉体凡胎的力量和能力”：超凡的力气、超凡的速度、超凡的视觉，还有会飞的能力。但还有一种更神奇的能力不得不提，那就是他那非凡人可及的、经久不衰的魅力。
In Superman's various incarnations over the years, he usually isn't reborn as someone fundamentally different from the character first seen in Action Comics No. 1─except in alternate-universe and 'elseworlds' stories, like the intriguing 'Red Son' comic book miniseries of 2003, which postulated what might have happened had the Kryptonian rocket landed in the Soviet Union rather than the American Midwest. Just the same, Superman's mythology has been continually fine-tuned and rewritten, most recently in the 2009 series 'Secret Origins, ' and expanded in the two bestselling 'Earth One' graphic novels of 2010 and 2012. One point that seems constantly up for grabs: the number of individuals, both heroes (Supergirl) and villains (General Zod)─and even animals (Krypto the Superdog)─who actually survived the destruction of Krypton.
这些年来各个版本的超人，跟首次出现在《动作漫画》(Action Comics)第一期的那个超人没有根本性的区别，例外情况只有那些讲平行宇宙和“异界”(elseworlds)的故事，比如2003年令人着迷的迷你连环漫画《红色之子》(Red Son)。这一系列漫画讲的是假如氪星人火箭降落在苏联而不是美国中西部则有可能发生什么事情。同样，有关超人的神话故事被不断地调整和改写（最近一次是2009年的《秘密起源》(Secret Origins)系列），并在2010年、2012年的畅销图文小说《超人：一号地球》(Earth One)第一部和第二部中得到进一步扩展。有一点似乎总是没有讲明白：氪星毁灭之后幸存者的数量，这些幸存者既有正派（超女）也有反派（佐德将军），甚至还包括动物（超狗小氪）。
The recasting began early. When Superman made his first appearance in print, it was explained that he was raised in an orphanage on Earth after a 'passing motorist' stumbled across the rocket containing the superinfant. Then, in June 1939, when Superman became the first comic-book character to star in his own self-titled publication, his background was retrofitted to become somewhat closer to the story we know today, in which the toddler of steel was raised by a kindly elderly couple named Kent. It wasn't until 1949 that Superman himself became aware that he was a 'strange visitor from another planet.'
改编在很早就开始了。超人第一次出现在平面媒体中的时候，背景介绍说他是在一位“过路的司机”撞上装有“超婴”的火箭之后，在地球上的一家孤儿院长大的。然后在1939年6月，超人成为第一个在以自己名字命名的出版物中充当主角的漫画书角色，他的来历经过了改编，一定程度上更加接近于我们今天所知道的故事，即这位钢铁孩被年迈而好心的肯特(Kent)夫妇抚养长大。直到1949年，超人才知道自己是“来自另一颗星球的陌生访客”。
Superman stories have proliferated in every medium, beginning with his two extremely long-running comic-book titles and a newspaper comic strip that launched in 1938-39. A radio series aired from 1940 to 1951, and Max Fleischer, best known for Betty Boop, produced the original animated series, which ran in movie theaters in 1941-1943. The first live-action depiction─a pair of Saturday-morning serials─arrived in 1948 and 1950.
超人故事已经衍生至各种各样的媒介形式，首先是两部特别长篇的漫画书和1938-1939年开始刊登的一个报纸漫画专栏。广播连续剧从1940年一直播到1951年；因贝蒂娃娃(Betty Boop)而出名的马克斯·弗莱舍(Max Fleischer)制作了最初的动画片系列，在1941年到1943年上映。第一批真人版电影（由Saturday-morning出品的两部片子）出现在1948年和1950年。
These, in turn, led to a true classic of early television, the 104 episodes of 'Adventures of Superman' (1952-58), which continue to captivate millions of kids in perpetual reruns and home-video releases. Lovers of 'I Love Lucy' also have long cherished the unforgettable 1957 episode of that series in which TV's Superman (George Reeves) rescues Lucy (Lucille Ball) after one of her harebrained schemes backfires. 'Do you mean to say that you've been married to her for 15 years?' Superman asks Ricky (Desi Arnaz). 'And they call me Superman!' Clearly, Jerry Seinfeld was right: the Man of Steel's most compelling power is a super sense of humor.
在这一切之后，出现了早期电视中一部真正的经典之作，即104集的《超人历险》(Adventures of Superman，1952-1958年)。通过无休止的重映和家庭录像带的发行，这部作品迄今仍让亿万儿童着迷。长期以来，剧集《我爱露西》(I Love Lucy)的粉丝们对1957年有超人加入的那一集也是喜爱有加。那一集讲的是露西（露西尔·鲍尔(Lucille Ball)扮演）的轻率计划失败之后，电视版超人（乔治·李维(George Reeves)扮演）解救了她。在剧集中，超人问德希·阿纳兹(Desi Arnaz)扮演的里奇(Ricky)：“你是说，你跟她结婚15年了？”得到肯定答复后他说：“他们可是管我叫超人的！”显然，喜剧演员杰瑞·宋飞(Jerry Seinfeld)说得对：这位钢铁英雄最迷人的能力是他的超级幽默感。
For the past 35 years, in particular, Superman has been especially omnipresent. Four big-screen, big-budget features, from 1978 to 1987, starred Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel. In 1989, Superman launched a marathon run of TV series that only a superhero could keep up with: 'Superboy, ' 'Lois and Clark, ' 'Superman: the Animated Series' and 'Smallville' have kept him in front of viewers with barely a pause to change his tights from 1988 to 2011.
尤其是过去35年，超人变得无处不在。从1978年到1987年，有四部大银幕、大制作影片都由克里斯托弗·里夫(Christopher Reeve)饰演钢铁英雄。1989年，超人开始出现在一长串只有超级英雄才追得上的电视连续剧当中：从1988年到2011年，《少年超人》(Superboy)、《露易斯和克拉克》(Lois and Clark)、《超人动画版》(Superman: the Animated Series)和《超人前传》(Smallville)使他一直处在观众视线中，几乎没有时间停下来换一下身上的紧身衣。
The expectations for a Superman project have soared so high that the 2006 theatrical feature 'Superman Returns' was considered a failure even though it grossed nearly $400 million. The new 'Man of Steel' will have what this 21st-century predecessor didn't: an origin story, which brings it more in line with such successes as 'Batman Begins, ' as well as biopics like 'Ray' and 'Walk the Line.'
由于人们对超人主题作品的期待是如此之高，2006年电影《超人归来》(Superman Returns)尽管拿到将近四亿美元的票房，结果还是被认为是一部失败之作。新的《钢铁之躯》将拥有《超人归来》所没有的东西：它的故事是原创的，这一点与《蝙蝠侠：侠影之迷》(Batman Begins)等成功作品以及《灵魂歌王》(Ray)和《与歌同行》(Walk the Line)等传记影片更为接近。
Superman has also been a persistent icon in popular music, from a dedicatory piece by Benny Goodman in 1940 to the ingenious 1966 Broadway musical 'It's a Bird . . . It's a Plane . . . It's Superman, ' which was recently restaged by City Center Encores! in New York with Edward Watts as the Baritone of Steel. There were also less flattering musical depictions, such as the 1979 'Rapper's Delight, ' in which the Sugar Hill Gang denigrates him as someone 'flying through the air in pantyhose.'
超人也是流行音乐中一个经久不衰的偶像，比如本尼·古德曼(Benny Goodman)1940年专为超人写的一首歌。又比如1966年结构精巧的百老汇音乐剧《超人正传》(It's a Bird…It's a Plane…It's Superman)。最近这部音乐剧又被纽约City Center Encores!重新搬上舞台，由爱德华·瓦茨(Edward Watts)饰演男中音的超人。也有一些对超人不那么恭维的音乐作品，比如1979年的《说唱歌手真高兴》(Rapper's Delight)。其中，说唱组合“糖山帮”(Sugar Hill Gang)把超人贬低为一个“穿着连裤口在空中飞”的人。
In print, even more than in movies and on TV, Superman continues to be a juggernaut. He still appears in multiple comic-book titles a month and is the subject of at least three serious 'biographies' in the past year, including Larry Tye's 'Superman: The High-Flying History of America's Most Enduring Hero' and Brad Ricca's 'Super Boys: The Amazing Adventures of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster─the Creators of Superman.'
在印刷媒体中，超人依旧拥有非凡的力量，比在电影和电视上更加强大。他依旧每月出现在好几部漫画书当中，过去一年至少担当了三部严肃“传记”的主角，如拉里·泰伊(Larry Tye)的《超人：美国最经典英雄的超凡历史》(Superman: The High-Flying History of America's Most Enduring Hero)，以及布拉德·里卡(Brad Ricca)的《超级男孩：超人之父杰里·西格尔和乔·舒斯特的神奇历险》(Super Boys: The Amazing Adventures of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster─the Creators of Superman)。
Apart from his obvious gifts, Superman's capacity for continual rebooting has kept him fresh from generation to generation: from leaping tall buildings in 1938 to traversing the solar system and even traveling through time in the 1960s and '70s, to surviving both death and matrimony in more recent decades. With 'Man of Steel, ' it's a sure bet that yet another generation of youngsters will be tying red towels around their necks and pretending that they can fly.
除了显而易见的天赋以外，超人持续“重启”的能力也使他一代不同于一代：1938年，他飞跃高楼；60年代和70年代，他穿越太阳系甚至穿越时光；到最近几十年，他又熬过了死亡和婚姻。有了《钢铁之躯》，可以肯定又会有一代小孩在脖子上系红毛巾假装他们会飞。
VOLGOGRAD, Russia — Like every Russian schoolchild, I grew up learning about Hitler’s murderous advance into Russia during World War II, and how it was halted at the Battle of Stalingrad — a critical turning point in the war.
俄罗斯伏尔加格勒——与每一名俄罗斯学童一样，我从小就被教导，在第二次世界大战期间，希特勒残暴地入侵了苏俄，斯大林格勒保卫战阻止了德国人——那场战役是“二战”的关键转折点。
The fight raged for 200 days, and the city was reduced to ruins. Civilians who couldn’t evacuate starved, some eating rats and clay. Resistance to the German onslaught was fierce as the defending army had no choice but to fend off the attack or die standing, following Stalin’s order: “Not one step back.”
战役激烈地进行了200天，城市化为废墟。没能逃走的平民饥寒交迫，有的人靠吃老鼠和泥土充饥。防卫军激烈地抵抗德军的攻势，为了服从斯大林“不准退后一步”的命令，他们别无选择，必须以生命为代价奋起抵抗。
At the end, a population that had been half a million was just 35,000.
最后，这座城市的50万人口只剩下3万5千人。
Since the war, the city has been completely rebuilt, and in 1961 was renamed Volgograd, an effort to erase Stalin’s legacy. But memories of the fighting, 75 years ago this year, are strong. Volgograders walking the streets or going to work pass by many kinds of memorials to those who sacrificed their lives.
战后，这座城市已经彻底重建，为了抹去斯大林的遗产，在1961年它更名为伏尔加格勒。但75年前那场战斗的记忆仍未消散，许多走在街头或在上班途中的伏尔加格勒人都会经过各种各样纪念先烈的纪念碑。
The main memorial is the Mamayev Kurgan complex, over which towers “The Motherland Calls,” a statue that symbolizes the common mother of all Russians leading them to engage in battle. Visible from almost every vantage point in the city, the statue is a powerful reminder of the price that Soviet people paid to defeat Nazism.
城里最重要的纪念性建筑是马马耶夫岗(Mamayev Kurgan complex)雕塑群，其中最高的是一尊名为《祖国母亲在召唤》(The Motherland Calls)的雕像，它象征俄罗斯人共同的母亲带领他们加入战斗。几乎从城市的每一个角度都能看到这尊雕像，它有力地提醒人们，苏联人民为战胜纳粹主义所付出的代价。
I have worked as a conflict photographer for more than 10 years. Once, when visiting Homs, Syria, in 2014, I found myself comparing the destruction I saw with that of Stalingrad. When I visit Volgograd now — modern, reconstructed — I wonder if Homs and other cities destroyed by war will ever look and feel like this.
我作为一个战地摄影师工作了超过10年。2014年，我在叙利亚的霍姆斯(Homs)，我把在那里看到的毁坏情况与斯大林格勒相比。当我来到今天这个现代的、重建一新的伏尔加格勒时，我想知道霍姆斯和其他被战争摧毁的城市会不会有一天也变成这样的模样、给人这样的感受。
When the Germans sent in tanks, Mikhail Panikakha was fighting in a trench. He had already thrown his grenades and had just two Molotov cocktails left. He was raising one bottle to throw when a bullet smashed it, setting him on fire. He took the remaining bottle, jumped out of the trench and hit the nearest German tank, setting it on fire. The other tanks withdrew.
德国人的坦克大举压境时，米哈伊尔·帕尼卡卡(Mikhail Panikakha)正在战壕中战斗。他已经扔光了手榴弹，只剩下两枚燃烧弹。当他举起其中一枚，准备向外扔去时，一颗子弹击碎燃烧弹，他自己着起了火。拿着剩下的一枚，他跳出战壕，甩向离自己最近的德军坦克，坦克燃烧了起来。其余的坦克纷纷后退。
After the fighting, all that remained of the village of Rossoshka, 35 kilometers (about 22 miles) from Volgograd, were ruins of buildings, ashes, shell craters and thousands of corpses. Today, two cemeteries stand at the site; 60,000 German soldiers are buried in one, 20,000 Soviet fighters in the other.
战斗结束后，距离伏尔加格勒35公里的罗斯诺什卡村(Rossoshka)只剩下一片废墟、灰烬、弹坑和数千人的尸体。今天，那里有两座墓地；一个埋葬着6万名德国军人，另一个埋葬着1.2万名苏联战士。
Each summer, groups of volunteers look for the remains of soldiers in fields and under city streets. In 2017, the bodies of 800 soldiers were discovered.
每年夏天，志愿者小组都会在田野里和城市街头下方寻找士兵遗骸。2017年，他们找到了800名士兵的遗体。
One day this summer, searchers unearthed the body of a Soviet fighter at the bottom of a pit a meter deep, his arms folded and legs bent.
今夏的一天，搜寻者从一个一米深的坑底挖出了一名苏联战士的遗骸，他双臂交叉，双腿弯曲。
During the war, the industrial part of the city was a station for tractors and tanks. Now, the yearly rock festival Volgorock is held there. This year, groups of young people danced between old metal constructions, above which hangs a billboard emblazoned with the word “Stalingrad.”
战争时期，城市的工业区是拖拉机和坦克的驻地。现在，一年一度摇滚音乐节伏尔加罗克(Volgorock)在那里举行。今年，一群群的年轻人在旧金属建筑之间跳着舞，上面悬挂的一块广告牌上印着“斯大林格勒”。
On the waterfront each summer, an orchestra plays popular songs from Soviet times.
每年夏天，一支管弦乐团都会在江畔演奏苏联时代的流行歌曲。
“I was about 5 years old when the Germans began to bomb Stalingrad,” recalled Anatoly Savin, who is 80-something and was dancing with his wife, Irina. “I was playing in the street when the rumble of planes and explosions began.”
80多岁的阿纳托利·萨温(Anatoly Savin)和妻子伊琳娜(Irina)跳着舞，“德国人开始轰炸斯大林格勒的时候，我大概5岁，”他回忆道。“我正在街上玩，听到轰炸机的轰鸣，然后爆炸开始了。”
Vladimir Turov, 97, is a war veteran. He said that every day, his battalion had forced back tank offensives, the bombs from the German air raids falling from the sky. On Sept. 12, 1942, his battalion was almost completely surrounded by Germans. But he refused to leave his wounded friend, fighting off the advancing forces with his machine gun. There was a huge explosion. His head spun and his eyes saw stars. He woke up in a hospital.
97岁的弗拉基米尔·图罗夫(Vladimir Turov)是一名退伍军人。他说，他当年所在的营每天都会迫退坦克的进攻和从天而降的德军空袭炸弹。1942年9月12日，他的营几乎完全被德国人包围。但他没有离开受伤的朋友，用机枪击退了前进的德军部队。一声巨响。他头晕目眩，眼冒金星。 醒来时，他在一间医院里。
The All Saints Church was built on the Mamayev Kurgan memorial complex in 1993, after the fall of the Soviet Union, so that believers could honor the memory of the fallen.
苏联解体后，万圣会教堂(The All Saints Church)于1993年在马马耶夫岗建成，信徒们能够在这里纪念逝去的人。
The battle created so many scars in this city that may never be totally healed. The Square of Heroes, also part of the memorial complex, contains a monument to a nurse carrying a wounded soldier from the battlefield.
那场战役给这座城市留下了如此多的伤痕，许多可能永远都无法愈合。英雄广场(The Square of Heroes)也是纪念建筑群的一部分，这里的一尊纪念碑刻着一个护士搀扶一名在前线受伤的士兵。
The Volga River was Hitler’s main target. Soviet soldiers fought to the death to keep possession of this strategic artery and important symbol. Now the calm, gentle surface of the river hides traces of the bloody fight. At the bottom of the river bed, burned-out ships, tanks, aircraft and the remains of thousands of soldiers still rest.
伏尔加河是希特勒的主要目标。为了保住这个战略动脉以及重要的象征，苏联战士与敌军决一死战。如今，这条河平静柔和的河面隐藏了血战的痕迹。在河底，烧毁的船只、坦克、飞机和数千名死去的士兵仍安息在那里。
Some 75 Chinese universities have unveiled their 2017 annual budget, which topped 350 billion RMB.
日前，中国75所高校公布了2017学年的预算，该总额超过了3500亿人民币。
Tsinghua University received the largest budget of 23.3-billion-RMB, making it the only university with a budget over 20 billion RMB.

据《新京报》报道，总共有8所大学的预算超过了100亿人民币，北大（193亿）和浙大（150亿）分别名列第二、三位。
Of the 75 universities, about 51 of them had a budget of less than 5 billion RMB.
在75所高校中，约51所高校预算少于50亿。
Three art colleges – the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Conservatory of Music, and The Central Academy of Drama – were at the bottom of the list, each receiving less than 1 billion RMB.
中央美术学院、中央音乐学院、中央戏剧学院等三所艺术院校预算最少，均不足10亿人民币。
According to Beijing News, Zhejiang University was the only university in the top ten of highest budgets that saw a slight decrease compared to last year.
据《新京报》报道，在预算最多的前十名高校中，浙大是唯一一所同比去年略有下降的大学。
At least eight universities reported an increase of over 2 billion RMB. The budget increase could be attributed to greater financial support from the government, as China vowed in 2016 to speed up the construction of world-class universities and first-class majors.
据报道，至少8所大学预算增加超过了20亿人民币。增加的预算来自于政府更大的财政支持--因为中国在2016年承诺加快建设世界级大学和一流专业。

78-year-old Luo Guangde recently completed the Berlin Marathon, clocking a personal best of 5 hours 28 minutes 30 seconds, shortening his previous 'PB' by 16 minutes.
78岁的罗广德最近完成了“柏林马拉松”，创造了5小时28分30秒的个人最好成绩，这要比他之前的最好成绩快了16分钟。
Only picking up running at the age of 75, Luo now ranks 28th in the world in the 75-and-above category for marathons, and is the only Chinese person in the group.
75岁才开始跑步的罗广德，如今在全球马拉松75岁以上年龄段中排名第28，且是唯一一名中国人。
A back injury had previously limited Luo's ability to run.
背部的伤势之前限制了罗广德的跑步能力。
However, Luo overcame the injury, and - despite some pain - was able to complete the Chongqing half-marathon with the assistance of his twin sons, who were the catalyst for his decision to begin running.
不过，罗广德克服了这些伤病--尽管有些疼痛，他还是在两个儿子的陪伴下完成了重庆半程马拉松，而儿子们是他决定开始跑步的催化剂。
He then competed in the Los Angeles Marathon in February, 2016.
之后，在2016年2月，他完成了洛杉矶马拉松。
After crossing the line under his own power, Luo decided to go for the "Marathon Grand Slam," which are the 6 largest marathons in the world.
在靠自己的力量冲过终点线之后，罗广德决定为“马拉松大满贯”--即世界上六大马拉松而努力。
He competed in the New York Marathon in November, 2016, and also took part in the London Marathon in April, 2017.
2016年11月，他完成了纽约马拉松；2017年4月，他又参加了伦敦马拉松。
"I plan to run in two Marathons in 2018, and one in 2019. By then I will be 80," said Luo.
罗广德表示：“我计划在2018年参加两场马拉松，2019年参加一场。那时我就要满80岁了。”
A man in northwest China's Shaanxi Province devoting himself for over 10 years to the invention of dual-use vehicles which can both run along the ground and fly in the sky received a patent for the invention this August, local media hsw.cn reported on Oct. 9, 2018.
据当地媒体10月9日报道，中国西北部陕西省一男子，10多年来一直致力于研发一种既能在地面上行驶又能在空中飞行的两用汽车，今年8月他终于拿到了这项发明的专利。
The patent was granted for the invention of "a solution for the aerodynamic configuration and power system of dual-use (land and air) sedan cars and service cars".
这项发明被授予“陆空两用小轿车和公务车的气动布局和动力配置实施方案”发明专利。
The inventor An Shuya, a 78-year-old retired senior mechanical engineer, started the study in 2000 and has become a regular visitor of the municipal library since then, immersing himself in books on automobile industrial technologies and aeronautical technologies.
发明者安树亚今年78岁了，是一位退休的高级机械工程师，他从2000年开始这项研究，成了市立图书馆的常客，潜心钻研汽车工业技术和航空工业技术方面的书籍。
He had been enjoying a happy life after retirement until one day, his wife shared her concern with the present traffic congestion, and suggested that her husband should do something about it.
退休后的他本来过着幸福的生活，直到有一天，他的妻子说现在路上经常堵车，建议他想想办法解决下。
Hearing this, the man decided to make use of his expertise in mechanical manufacturing and attempted to create a "flying car" so as to help resolve the traffic jam issue.
听到这，他决定利用自己在机械制造方面的专业知识，发明一辆“飞车”，以帮助解决交通堵塞问题。
When his study finally yielded fruits, as a gift to his wife, An applied for the patent with the name of his wife.
他的钻研最终取得了成果，作为送给妻子的礼物，这项发明专利以妻子的名字命名。
The invention is a combination of the automobile and aircraft, and this new type dual-use vehicle is at present a conceptual machine that needs further detailed development and manufacturing, An explained.
安树亚解释说，他的发明其实是将现有常用的汽车技术与航空技术巧妙连接，这种新型的两用车当前只是一种概念车，需要更多的细节化的研究和创造。
"I haven't been able to materialize the vehicle, for it needs complicated and refined manufacturing techniques," An said, hoping that people of vision could help him to materialize the invention.
安树亚表示：“我还没法做出实物，因为这需要复杂而精妙的制造”。他期待着有识之士能帮他物质化这个发明。
Dads are famous for the adorably embarrassing things they do to their children. However, this Utah father's act might have gone a bit too far for his 48-year-old son.
父亲们常常因给子女做出尴尬的事而闻名。不过，一位来自美国犹他州的父亲，为他48岁的儿子所做的事，可是更让人哭笑不得。
Salt Lake City businessman Baron Brooks said he was mortified when he saw his own smiling face on a full-page newspaper ad in a North Idaho paper, the Coeur d'Alene Press.
犹他州盐湖城的商人巴伦·布鲁克斯声称，当他看到自己的那张笑脸被刊登在科达伦出版社北爱达荷报整页的广告版面时，感到非常羞愧。
"I am looking for a wife who is ready, willing and able to have children as soon as possible," the ad in the Coeur d'Alene Press read.
科达伦出版社的这则广告是这样写的："我正在找寻一个准备、愿意、能尽快生孩子的妻子"。
The notice listed an age range — 34 to 38 — and assorted other demands, including that the woman agree to be a stay-at-home mom and that she be conservative. "If you voted for Obama or plan to vote for Hillary you are not for me."
广告上还写着女性的年龄范围--最好在34到38岁之间，还有一些其他的要求，比如愿意当家庭主妇，以及得是保守派。"如果你曾为奥巴马投票，或者计划投票给希拉里，那么你和我不合适。"
He said his 78-year-old father, Arthur Brooks, placed the ad looking for a wife for his son. "If I die now, I want it to be known by medical science, that one can die from embarrassment," he told Q13 News.
巴伦表示，这则广告是他78岁的父亲亚瑟·布鲁克斯刊登的，只为了替儿子找个妻子。他在接受Q13新闻记者采访时表示："如果我现在死了，我想要医学家们知道，一个人是有可能死于尴尬的。"
Baron said he doesn't want to hurt his father's feelings so he is allowing his dad to go ahead and interview candidates to be his future wife.
巴伦表示自己不想伤了父亲的心，因此他允许父亲继续这样做下去，并愿意与未来妻子的候选人见见面。
Fridays are the least productive day in many offices. People are scrambling to get things down before the weekend. Others are ditching and leaving early or not working at all. However, you don’t have to let it impact your productivity. Let’s reclaim our Fridays。
在许多办公场所，周五都是工作效率最低的一天。人们赶在周末来临前仓促地把事情搞定。其他人则提早下班或者根本就不进行工作了。然而你大可不必让周五来影响你的工作效率。我们来改造一下周五吧。
Is Friday a productive day in your workplace? Friday seems to be the most dysfunctional day of the week. (After Monday, of course。) Many people write off their Fridays as a non-productive close to their week。
在你工作的地方周五是高效的一天吗？周五似乎是一周当中最不正常的一天。(当然要排在万恶的星期一之后。)许多人都认为周五是一周结束前最没效率的一天。
But it doesn’t have to be that way. In fact, Fridays can be one of the best days to actually get work done. Let’s make our Fridays productive again。
但我们可以改变这种状况。 事实上，周五可以成为真正把事情做好的一天。我们再次让周五充满高效吧。
Here are 7 Things to Eliminate From Your Fridays to Make Them More Productive:
消灭以下7件事可以让你的周五更加高效：
1. Email
电子邮件
Get out of your inbox and get productive. Stop waging the email war. Some companies have designated Friday “email free” and it has made a tremendous impact on their team’s ability to get work done。
从你的收件箱中摆脱出来，让自己更有效率。不要再卷入邮件大战中了。有些公司指定周五不处理电子邮件，这对团队完成工作的能力产生了巨大的影响。
2. Meetings
会议
Meetings have taken up way too much of our work week already. Let’s declare “No Meeting Fridays” and reclaim at least one day a week from scheduled meetings。
会议已经占据了我们一周当中太多的工作时间。让我们呼吁“周五不开会”，而且至少从每周中取消一天安排好的会议。
3. Negativity
消极性
It’s the end of the week, and there is no time for being negative. Leave out the complaining, whining, and gossiping. Don’t associate with those who do it. You’ll be long gone for your weekend while they’re still telling stories。
马上就要周末了，没有时间消极。不要抱怨、牢骚、闲聊了。不要与那些爱抱怨、牢骚、闲聊的人交往。当他们仍在讲故事的时候你就要迎接你的周末了。
4. Phone
电话
Friday is a great day to stay off the phone. Instead of talking on the phone, go see people in person. For those who are remote workers, this may not be possible. But you can try other more personal ways to communicate such as Facetime or Skype. The extra effort always pays off in the relationships built. You can’t communicate at the same level when you can’t see someone。
在周五应该远离电话。要亲自与人见面，而不是用电话交谈。对于那些远程工作者来说这或许不太可能，然而你可以尝试其他更亲近的方法来与他们交流，例如Facetime或Skype。额外的努力总是值得的，这有利于人际关系的建立。如果你无法见到某人，你们是不可能在同一个层次上交流的。
5. Interruptions
干扰
One of the best ways to reclaim your Friday is to limit interruptions. Find a place to do uninterrupted work. Maybe it means reserving a meeting room or even going offsite. Of course, you should make sure your team know how to reach you for a true emergency before you “go silent” 。
改造周五的最佳方法之一就是限制干扰。找一个地方进行不被干扰的工作。这可能意味着预订一间会议室，甚至走出你的办公场所。当然，在你“隐身沉默” 之前要跟团队打好招呼，让他们知道发生紧急情况的时候要去哪儿找你。
6. Unnecessary Paperwork
不必要的文书工作
Keep Friday for the important work, such as the creative work that you can’t get large time blocks for during the week. Leave the unnecessary paperwork for later. Much of the paper-shuffling is unneeded in the big scheme of things。
将周五留给重要的工作。就是那些你似乎无法在一周当中留出大段时间的创造性工作。将那些不必要的文书工作推后。许多我们所做的拖拖拉拉的文书工作，其实在大的框架计划中根本不需要。
7. Work Hours
工作时间
I am a big proponent of the “results oriented work environment。” Get your work done and get out. There is no reason to expand your work to fit the time. In a ROWE, those who have been working hard all week can go home early. The rest can stay and finish their work. :)
我强烈拥护以结果为导向的工作氛围。完成工作就走。没有理由将工作延长来适应上班时间。在以结果为导向的工作环境中，那些一周都勤奋工作的人可以提早回家。其他人则继续呆在办公室完成他们的工作。
Don’t let your Fridays fall prey to the chaotic end of the work week. With a little effort, Fridays can be the most productive day of the week。
不要让你的周五成为混乱结束一周工作的牺牲品。多做一点点努力，就能让周五成为一周当中最高效的一天。
Chinese GDP growth slowed to 7.7% last year, hitting its lowest level since 1999.
去年中国的GDP增长下降到7.7%，是1999年以来最低的水平。
Some of the biggest issues we're seeing in the headlines these days are concerns over shadow banking, rising local government debt, and trust defaults.
近来我们在新闻标题中看到的最大问题包括对影子银行、不断上升的地方政府债务以及信托基金违约的担忧。
The credit crunch China experienced last year, and the worry that deleveraging could trigger a hard landing is also getting a lot of attention.
同时，中国去年经历的信贷紧缩以及担心去杠杆化会引发经济硬着陆越来越引起人们的大量关注。
We asked six China experts the same question. What worries you the most about China? Here are their responses:
我们向六位中国问题专家提出了同一个问题：最担心中国什么？以下是他们的答复。
Alaistair Chan, Moody's: "The central bank’s campaign to cut risky lending practices and over-leverage in the financial sector via monetary tightening is a big concern. The PBoC seems to have learned from the June 2013 Shibor scare, but it is still unclear how monetary tightening against a backdrop of potential defaults in corporate bonds this year will unfold."
穆迪公司阿来斯蒂尔·钱（Alaistair Chan）：“中央银行通过货币紧缩降低金融行业风险信贷以及过度杠杆化的行动非常令人担忧。中国人民银行似乎已经汲取了2013年上海银行间同业拆放利率恐慌的教训，但尚不清楚在公司债券方面针对潜在违约的货币紧缩政策将如何展开。”
David Cui, Bank of America: "Debt growth and corporate sector solvency issue."
美洲银行的戴维·崔（David Cui）：“债务增长以及企业部门的偿付能力问题。”
Patrick Chovanec, Silvercrest Asset Management: "I'm worried that Chinese leaders actually believe it when they say everything is under control. The clock is fast running out on China's tactic of using runaway credit to fuel investment-led growth.
Silvercrest资产管理公司帕特里克·乔维尼克（Patrick Chovanec）。“我担心中国领导人在说一切都在掌控下时，他们实际上真的相信这一点。中国利用失控的信贷维持投资引导型经济增长，这种策略正在迅速走向末日。”
"At best China faces a growth squeeze from a mounting burden of bad debt, at worse that bad debt will blow up in its face. Either way, China faces a wrenching economic adjustment. If China's leaders recognize not just the direction but also the urgency of change, they have some hope of getting to the other side. If they kid themselves into complacency, they are courting disaster."
“最好的情况是，中国面临增长因沉重债务负担引起的经济增长紧缩，更遭的情况则是，坏债将让中国直接栽跟头。无论是哪种方式，中国将面临痛苦的经济调整。如果中国领导人不但明白改革的方向，而且认识到改革的紧迫性，他们还有可能度过难关。如果幼稚地陷入沾沾自喜，将招致灾难。
George Magnus, Formerly UBS: "Among many things that worry me, the most urgent issue is if, how and under what circumstances China will tame credit creation and put a troublesome genie back in the bottle. We've had a few trust loan defaults that haven't caused a big stir yet, but there have been a couple of depositor bail outs that don't point to a determined attempt to curb the excess yet.
UBS的乔治·马格努斯（George Magnus）：“在令我担心的许多事情当中，最为紧迫的是中国是否会并在什么样的条件下驯服信贷创造，将制造麻烦的妖魔重新放回瓶子里。我们已经看到了一些信托贷款违约事件，但没有造成很大轰动，不过，已经有了两三件存款人救助的案例，但这些案例并还未显示出消除过分信贷的坚定努力。”
"There's a tension between the PBoC and the China Banking regulatory Commission over shadow banking restraint. I expect credit to slow and to lead to slower growth. I worry that the authorities will try to soft pedal this, leading to a bigger denouement later."
“在约束影子银行问题上，中国人民银行和中国银行业监督管理委员会关系紧张。我预计信贷会放缓，导致经济增长放缓。我担心政府试图减缓这一措施，导致后来形成更严重的结果。”
Jim Rogers, Rogers Holdings: "The high levels of debt in some areas. Some of the provinces and companies have built up debt in recent years during the recovery, since there has been so very much artificial liquidity all over the world. All the money printing in the developed world is causing distortions everywhere including China."
罗杰斯控股（Rogers Holdings）吉米·罗杰斯：“有些地区存在的高债务问题。在最近几年的经济恢复期间，因为整个世界范围内存在非常高的人为流动性，一些省市和公司债务水平大幅提高。发达国家印发的所有货币在包括中国在内所有国家里制造了扭曲。”
Tom Orlik, Bloomberg: "The biggest worry about China this year is the state of the financial system. Massive credit growth has left banks overexposed, and as the economy slows the cracks are starting to show."
彭博社汤姆·奥立克（Tom Orlik）：“有关中国今年最大的担心是金融体系的状况。巨大规模的信贷增长将银行过度地暴露在风险之下，随着经济放缓，裂痕已经开始显现。”
Bill Bishop, Sinocism: "A. Environmental crises: air, water, soil, food. There are and will continue to be huge opportunities for investors and companies in cleaning up the mess, but the human toll is massive and will get worse before it gets better. It could lead to significant unrest but more likely will lead to cancer epidemics and emigration by those who can afford to;
Sinocism的利明璋：“第一，环境危机：空气、水、土壤。对投资人和企业来说，清理这些污染存在，而且将继续存在巨大的机会，但是污染将造成巨大的人身伤亡，在彻底得到扭转之前，这种情况会变得更糟。环境危机可能引起大的动乱，但更大的可能是造成多种癌症蔓延，以及具有经济能力人士的移民。”
B. Corruption. Xi's crackdown on official corruption is serious and having an effect. Of course there are political reasons and scores to settle, but the crackdown has changed behavior. It has not however addressed the corruption that is pervasive in Chinese society, and it is hard though to see how that can be changed materially in the midst of increasing restriction on public discourse and transparency;
第二，腐败问题。习近平打击官员腐败的行动是严肃而有成效的。当然，打击腐败存在多种政治理由，也能得到政治得分，但是打击活动已经改变了行为。不过，并没有解决在中国社会普遍存在的腐败问题。在对公共话题以及透明性限制不断增加的环境下，很难看到实质性的变化。
C. Ideological retrenchment. No, Xi is not a "neo-Maoist", but he is a pragmatic Marxist and there is a broader tightening of discourse and more aggressive rejection of "Western" values and Neo-liberalism than we have seen in a while. But most people here do not believe in Marxism and a Marxist morality campaign will not work. So the real glue is nationalism, and that has only grown stronger, intentionally, over the years;
第三，思想紧缩。习绝对不是“新派毛分子”，但他是位实用的马克思主义者。最近以来出现大范围的紧缩政治话语，以及对“西方”价值和新自由主义激励的排斥，超过了我们以前的观察。但是，这里的绝大多数人并不相信马克思主义，马克思主义道德运动将不起作用。因此，真正的粘合剂是民族主义，近年来，民族主义被人为得到增强。
D. Growing anti-foreign, and especially anti-American, sentiment as more and more people are told, and start to believe, that the West is trying to keep China down and prevent its rejuvenation. Tensions from an economic slowdown, economic reform/restructuring and/or the corruption crackdown and its political re-ordering could lead to even more external friction than would normally be expected with a rising power. Geoff Dyer's new book "The Contest of the Century: The New Era of Competition with China" is worth reading.
第四，随着越来越多地人被告知并且相信，西方正在试图打压中国，阻止中国复兴，反外情绪，尤其是反美情绪得到不断增强。经济增长放缓、经济改革/重组、反腐和政治秩序重构引起的紧张关系将导致更多的外部摩擦，超过了一般情况下新兴大国的预期。杰夫·戴尔的新书《世纪竞赛：与中国竞争的新时代》值得一读。
China's brick-and-mortar banks are launching a counter-attack against the assault on their business from Alibaba and other Internet heavyweights, in a bid to staunch the outflow of bank deposits into high-yielding online investment products.
据路透社报道，为了应对来自阿里巴巴及其他互联网巨头对中国传统银行业务的影响，中国传统银行正发起反击，旨在阻止银行存款外流到高收益率的互联网投资产品。
In less than eight months, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's money market fund, Yu'e Bao, has attracted 400 billion yuan ($66.0 billion) in assets under management, more than the customer deposits held by the five smallest listed Chinese banks.
还不到八个月，阿里巴巴集团旗下的货币市场基金产品--余额宝总共吸收了4000亿元（约660亿美元），超过了5家中国最小规模上市银行的客户存款总和。
Similar online products from Baidu Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd also contributed to a fall of one trillion yuan in traditional bank deposits in January.
百度公司及腾讯控股有限公司旗下类似的互联网产品也是一月份中国传统银行存款流失一万亿元的原因。
"Yu'e Bao and similar products are posing a very strong competitive challenge to banks," said Zennon Kapron, head of Kapronasia, a finance and technology consultancy based in Hong Kong. "Although the amount of money that (online products) have attracted is still small as a portion of banks' overall deposit base, it's very significant in terms of the speed at which they've grown."
香港一家金融技术咨询公司Kapronasia的负责人Zennon Kapron表示：“余额宝及其他类似的互联网产品正对中国传统银行发起一股强有力的挑战，尽管这类互联网产品吸收的资金总量与银行存款总额相比仍然不大，但是其增长速度是相当惊人的。”
Now traditional lenders, initially caught flat-footed, are striking back.
如今，措手不及的传统银行正开始反击。
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China , Bank of China , Bank of Communications and Ping An Bank have all launched new products in recent weeks that match the attractive features of Yu'e Bao.
最近几周，中国工商银行，中国银行，交通银行及平安银行全都推出了新的产品，对抗余额宝。
Banks are also lobbying regulators to introduce curbs on the growth of on-line funds offered by non-banks.
银行还在游说监管部门采取措施，控制互联网产品的发展。
Ultimately, however, competition for deposits will drive up banks' funding costs and crimp profit margins this year.
然而，最终各类产品对存款的竞争将会提高银行今年的融资成本，降低其利润空间。
As China gradually moves to liberalize deposit interest rates, banks will be forced to compete among themselves to attract customers, which means offering higher yields.
随着存款利率不断地自由化，中国传统银行将会被迫进行内部竞争，提供更高回报率的产品，吸引客户。
The development of new deposit-like money market products designed to compete with online rivals will further accelerate the trend toward higher funding costs.
旨在与互联网产品对抗的新型类存款资金市场产品将会进一步加速融资成本的增大。
"It's going to negatively affect bank margins. Costs will go up," said May Yan, Asia ex-Japan banks analyst at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong.
前日本银行亚洲分析师，香港巴克莱资本的May Yan表示：“这样一来，银行利润率将会受到不利影响，成本将上涨。”
CASH ON DEMAND
现钱交易
Chinese savers in recent years have flocked to so-called wealth management products (WMPs) that banks market as a higher-yielding alternative to traditional savings deposits, which remain subject to a cap of 3.3 percent for one-year savings.
近年来，中国储户热捧银行所谓高回报率的理财产品（WMPs），并从传统年利率上线为3.3%的储户存款中解放出来。
Alibaba super-charged the switch away from traditional deposits last June when it launched Yu'e Bao in partnership with Tianhong Asset Management Co Ltd, in which it owns a 51 percent stake. The product is currently yielding 6.2 percent.
去年六月，阿里巴巴与天弘资产管理有限公司携手发行余额宝，就完全主导着银行传统存款的外流。阿里巴巴持有天弘资产管理有限公司51%的股份，该产品目前的年化收益率为6.2%。
Beyond the attractive yield, several innovations allowed Yu'e Bao and other online money-market funds to draw funds away from bank deposits and offline WMPs. Unlike most bank WMPs, the Yu'e Bao fund allows investors to redeem shares for cash at any time, rather than locking up their funds for months at a time. Yu'e Bao also requires no minimum threshold to buy in.
余额宝及其他互联网货币市场基金之所以能够从传统的银行存款及线下理财产品中吸收资金，除了诱人的高回报外，还得益于其几项创新改革。与大多数银行理财产品不同的是，余额宝允许投资者随时赎回资金，而不是一次就锁定他们的资金好几个月。而且余额宝没有设置最低投资门槛。
The product's seamless integration with Alibaba's widely used third-party payments platform, Alipay, also makes buying into the product simple and convenient.
余额宝与支付宝（阿里巴巴旗下被广泛使用的第三方支付平台）的完美结合，也使得购入该产品更为简单方便。
Now banks are getting in on the act with their own cash-on-demand money market products.
现在，各银行都行动起来，推出各自现钱交易的资金市场产品。
ICBC, the world's largest bank by assets, launched a money-market WMP called "Tiantian Yi, which translates as "Everyday Benefit." So far only account holders based in the eastern province of Zhejiang are allowed to purchase, but the pilot is likely to ramp up quickly.
世界上资产总量最大的银行--中国工商银行，发行了资金市场理财产品--“天天益”。目前只有浙江地区的储户才能购买天天益，但是工商银行将有可能很快地扩大其试点范围。
ICBC hopes to gain an edge over Alibaba by allowing customers to transfer up to 30 million yuan into its product, known as "Everyday Increase."
工商银行希望赢得与阿里巴巴竞争的优势，借“天天益”吸收存款达3000万元。
ICBC has also fought back by limiting its depositors monthly transfers to Alipay to 50,000 yuan per month.
另外，工商银行还规定，储户每月向支付宝转账的金额不得超过5万元。
Bocom, China's fifth largest lender, has launched "Quick Benefit Channel," while Ping An Bank has a product called "Ping An Profit."
中国的第五大商业银行--交通银行，推出了“快溢通”，平安银行则推出了“平安盈”。
Bank of Beijing Co Ltd , a mid-sized lender, on Wednesday announced a partnership with smartphone maker Xiaomi Tech on mobile payments and sales of WMPs and insurance products.
周三，中等规模的北京银行宣布与智能手机生产商小米科技建立合作伙伴关系，合作范围涉及移动支付及销售理财产品和保险产品。
Banks are also tweaking WMPs to make them more competitive.
银行也正对各自理财产品作调整，使其更具竞争力。
"We're trying to increase the convenience of our WMPs, like letting people buy them during non-working hours. We're also asking the bank regulator to let us lower the 50,000 yuan minimum investment for some products," said a wealth product manager at a mid-sized bank in Shanghai.
上海一家中等规模银行的理财产品经理表示：“我们正试图增加我们理财产品的便利性，比如说：在非工作时段让客户购买我们的产品。我们也在要求监管部门放宽某些产品5万元的投资门槛。”
CALLS FOR REGULATION
要求监管
UBS estimates that if 10 percent of total bank deposits flow into online products, it could reduce banks' net interest margin by 0.1 percentage points, while lost fee income would amount to 4 percent of estimated 2014 net profit.
瑞士联合银行预计，如果银行总存款的10%流入互联网产品，那么银行的净利差可能减少0.1个百分点，同时手续费收入将会损失高达2014年预计净利润的4%。
The China Securities Regulatory Commission said last week that it is working with other agencies to develop rules for Internet finance. Industry observers say that banks are lobbying for curbs on the proliferation of online products from third-party payment services.
上周，中国证监会表示他们正与其他部门就互联网融资制定相关规则。业内观察家们表示各银行正在游说监管部门，从第三方支付服务方面阻止互联网产品的扩张。
"Regulators are trying to walk a fine line. They don't want to kill innovation that benefits consumers, but they also don't want deposit-taking activity that's completely unregulated," said Yan.
Yan 表示：“监管部门正试图找出个折中的办法。他们不想扼杀一切有利于消费者的改革创新，但是他们也不想融资活动处于完全不被监管的状态。”
Analysts say that even if banks are able to draw funds into their own money-market products the trend of rising funding costs will continue, as the banks' products would have to match the yields offered by online rivals.
分析师表示即使银行有能力吸引资金投资他们的货币市场产品，融资的成本增加的趋势还会继续，因为银行产品将不得不与由互联网竞争对手提供的高回报产品进行抵抗。
Indeed, funds invested in Yu'e Bao and similar products eventually end up with banks anyway. Tianhong uses Yu'e Bao funds to invest mainly in interbank deposits and repurchase agreements. So whether banks borrow from Tianhong or raise funds from their own products, the cost is still higher than on ordinary deposits.
的确，投资在余额宝及其他类似产品的资金最终会流向银行。天弘主要把余额宝资金投入到同业存款及回购上。因此，不管银行是向天弘借贷，还是从自己的产品中融资，成本仍旧比普通存款高。
"The money stays in the system, but (online products) turn cheap deposits into expensive ones," said May Yan, Asia ex-Japan banks analyst at Barclays Capital in Hong Kong. ($1=6.0641 Chinese yuan)
前日本银行亚洲分析师，巴克莱银行的May Yan表示：“虽然资金还在银行系统里，但是互联网产品将廉价存款的成本提高。”（1美元=6.0641元）
A pair of brave 7-year-old Texas boys helped foil their own kidnapping when they screamed and fought off a thief who stole their mother's car.
美国德克萨斯州一对勇敢的7岁双胞胎兄弟遭绑架时大声呼叫，勇斗偷车贼，最终成功脱险。
San Antonio mom Lucia Lozada said she was on her way to church Thursday afternoon when a man she knew from the neighborhood jacked her gold Nissan Altima with her twin boys and 1-year-old baby inside.
事件发生在德州的圣安东尼奥市，母亲露西亚称，周四下午她正在去教堂的路上，一名男子劫持了她的车，当时车上只有7岁大的双胞胎兄弟和1岁的小婴儿。
"She realized that she had forgotten the baby bottle, walked back in the house. When she came back out the car was gone." San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said.
当地警察称：“当时，露西亚发现自己忘带奶瓶，便下车走回房子。然而，当她回来时汽车竟不见了。”
But cops said the tykes, Luis and Lucius, refused to go quietly and began hitting the man and screaming.
据警察说，双胞胎兄弟路易斯和卢修斯拒绝和男子离开，他们不断打这名男子，并不停尖叫。
"I was hitting him with a toy snake," little Luis told reporters.
双胞胎之一的路易斯告诉记者：“当时，我用我的玩具蛇不停地打他。”
Eventually, the carjacker let the boys and the baby off on a street in Las Palmas, about 10 miles away from their home.
最终，这个抢车贼让这对男孩和他们的弟弟在帕尔马斯大街下车，此地离他们家已有10英里。
They were reunited with their mother on Thursday evening.
周四晚上，他们回到了母亲身边。
They got the snake yesterday from the store, Lozada told KSAT-TV. "I didn't want to buy it for them, but I guess God knew that he was going to use it today."
母亲露西亚称：“玩具蛇是昨天才从商店里买的，当时我还不想买，不过可能是上帝知道他们今天用得着。”
Lozada said she'd seen the carjacker around her neighborhood in southeast San Antonio from time to time.
露西亚曾看到这名抢车贼在圣安东尼奥市东南部转悠。

《牡丹花下》
Sofia Coppola became the second woman ever to win the Best Director prize at Cannes for her remake of the 1971 Clint Eastwood revenge tale set in the deep South. Nicole Kidman is the headmistress of a girls' boarding school, who agrees to shelter a wounded Union soldier (Colin Farrell): rivalries simmer in the Gothic Western that also stars Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning.
索菲亚?科波拉翻拍了克林特?伊斯特伍德1971年的《牡丹花下》，并凭此成为戛纳电影节历史上的第二位最佳女导演。影片讲述了一个发生在美国南方的复仇故事。妮可?基德曼饰演的女子寄宿学校校长同意收留科林?法瑞尔饰演的北方军伤兵。各种冲突也由此埋下了种子。这部西方哥特式惊悚电影的演员还包括克尔斯滕?邓斯特和艾丽?范宁。
Coppola has shifted the original film's narrative focus from the soldier to the women, ramping up the sexual tension. "The main crux of the story is about the dynamics between a group of women all stuck together, and then also the power shifts between men and women," she told Entertainment Weekly. "So for me, it's very universal, but it's in this exotic setting of the Southern gentility."
科波拉将原版电影中的士兵视角改成女性视角，加剧了片中的性别冲突。她告诉《娱乐周刊》："故事主要讲述的是一群在一起的女性之间的互动关系，以及男女之间的权力转移问题。对我而言，这是一个全球性的话题，但是片中南方上流社会的背景设定很有意思。"
（Spider-Man: Homecoming）
《蜘蛛侠：英雄归来》
After his debut as a young Peter Parker in Captain America: Civil War, Tom Holland fleshes out the character as he returns home to his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). Robert Downey Jr co-stars as his mentor Tony Stark, and Michael Keaton takes on a villain role as the Vulture. The reboot of the Spider-Man franchise is the 16th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Holland confirmed that his character had been part of the MCU since 2010. Director Jon Watts has said "I do feel like now that Spider-Man is a part of this big crazy universe we can definitely tell some new stories".
汤姆?赫兰德饰演的"小蜘蛛侠"彼得?帕克在《美队3》中首次亮相后，回到家和姑妈梅（玛丽萨?托梅饰）一起生活。他在片中将蜘蛛侠刻画成一个有血有肉的角色。片中另一位主演--钢铁侠的扮演者小罗伯特?唐尼饰演蜘蛛侠的导师。而迈克尔?基顿则扮演反派角色"秃鹫"。漫威影业此次翻拍的蜘蛛侠系列电影是其第16部作品，赫兰德证实，蜘蛛侠从2010年起就属于漫威电影宇宙。导演乔?沃茨称："我觉得现在蜘蛛侠是这个庞大的疯狂宇宙的一分子了，我们可以明确地展开新剧情啦。"
（War for the Planet of the Apes）
《猩球崛起3：终极之战》
The third part of the rebooted trilogy has drawn praise for offering a fitting climax to a critically-acclaimed blockbuster franchise, balancing epic action with nuanced performances. The Telegraph describes the film as a soulful, mesmerizing spectacle, arguing " Matt Reeves marshals more than his fair share of battle scenes and sweeping set-pieces, but never forgets the flicker of a face can provide all the spectacle that cinema requires." Andy Serkis reprises his role as the leader of the apes, Caesar, who leaves his tribe on a revenge quest that ends in a battle between humans and hominids. It's as much about internal as external conflict, with EW commenting that "like Caesar and company, the films seem to be getting more intelligent and human as they evolve".
翻拍的《猩球崛起》三部曲第三部口碑不错，为这个广受好评的系列大片制造了完美的高潮，片中史诗级的动作场面与细腻的表演相得益彰。《每日电讯报》称，影片的场景深情且令人惊叹。"马特?里夫斯不仅合理安排了打斗场面和宏大场景，而且也懂得一张闪现的人脸能胜过所有大场面的道理。"安迪?瑟金斯再次饰演猿人首领凯撒，他为了复仇离开部落，最终引发了人类和人猿之间的战争。影片既刻画了角色的内心矛盾，也刻画了外部的冲突。《娱乐周刊》评价道："就像凯撒和他的同伴一样，《猩球崛起》系列电影不断进步，变得越来越有内涵且人性化。"
（Dunkirk）
《敦刻尔克》
Director Christopher Nolan follows up the Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Interstellar with what's set to be one of the most ambitious historical war movies yet. He has used a real naval destroyer in battle sequences, and there have been rumours that Warner Bros paid $5m for a vintage World War II aeroplane. The ensemble cast includes Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, Fionn Whitehead and One Direction's Harry Styles, and long-time Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer provides the score. Nolan has re-enacted the 1940 evacuation of more than 300,000 stranded Allied troops from the beaches of Dunkirk, telling Total Film "it's on a colossal scale," but "it's a survival story more than a war film."
继《黑暗骑士》三部曲、《盗梦空间》和《星际穿越》之后，克里斯托弗?诺兰执导了《敦刻尔克》，该片似乎是迄今为止最宏大的历史战争题材电影之一。诺兰启用了一艘货真价实的海军驱逐舰，传言华纳兄弟斥资500万美元（约合3400万人民币）购买了一架二战时期的老式飞机。该片演员阵容包括汤姆?哈迪、肯尼斯?布莱纳、马克?里朗斯、斯里安?墨菲、费昂?怀特黑德以及One Direction组合的哈利?斯泰尔斯。诺兰的老搭档汉斯?季默为该片配乐。1940年，30多万受困盟军士兵从敦刻尔克海滩撤退，诺兰重现了这一历史事件，他告诉《完全电影》杂志说，"这是一部大制作"，但"与其说它是战争片，不如说这是一个关于生存的故事"。
（The Midwife）
《助产士》
Catherine Deneuve drew praise from Variety for her "fearless turn as a boozing, ailing wreck" in this film written and directed by Martin Provost. Catherine Frot plays an uptight midwife who forms an unlikely friendship with the free-wheeling, estranged mistress of her late father (Deneuve). Screen Daily has called the two actors "consummate performers who inhabit their diametrically opposed characters with satisfying élan".
《助产士》由马丁?波渥斯担任编剧及导演，《综艺》杂志称赞凯瑟琳?德纳芙"挑战一个嗜酒贪杯、境况不佳、身体虚弱的角色很有勇气"。凯瑟琳?弗洛扮演一名焦虑的助产士，她和自己已故父亲曾经的情妇（德纳芙饰）建立起不可思议的友谊，德纳芙是个自由放纵的女人。《银幕日报》称，这两位演员"用精湛的演技将两个截然相反的角色演绎得淋漓尽致。"
（The Big Sick）
《大病》
Hailed as one of the best rom-coms in recent years, The Big Sick was written by the married couple Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V Gordon, and is based on the story of their courtship. Nanjiani plays himself, while Zoe Kazan is Gordon - and the plot is "the kind of sweetly funny movie love story that's so bizarre that it has to be real", according to The Wrap. Meeting when Nanjiani was an aspiring stand-up comedian, they have to navigate his parents - traditional Muslims from Pakistan - and a mystery illness leaves Gordon in a medically-induced coma.
《大病》被誉为近年来最优秀的爱情喜剧电影之一，该片由库梅尔?南贾尼和艾米丽?V?戈登夫妇基于两人的爱情故事改编而成。南贾尼饰演他本人，而佐伊?卡赞饰演艾米丽?V?戈登。据《The Wrap》杂志称，这是一部"甜蜜中带着诙谐的爱情故事片，荒诞却又真实"。电影中南贾尼是一个胸怀大志的脱口秀喜剧演员，他和戈登不得不投奔他的父母（来自巴基斯坦的传统穆斯林），而戈登得了一场奇怪的大病，并陷入由药物引发的昏迷。
（Hounds of Love）
《爱的猎犬》
When she is abducted by a serial killer couple in Perth, Vicki (Ashleigh Cummings) attempts to drive a wedge between the pair in order to survive. This feature debut from the Australian writer/director Ben Young is a "bone-chilling horror-thriller", according to The Guardian; "a savagely intense and frightening tale of suburban sickos that is hands down the scariest movie you'll see this year". Stephen Curry and Emma Booth play the married psychopaths, with Young looking at the motivations of female murderers and the psychodrama of destructive relationships as well as delivering shocks on a par with The Babadook or Snowtown.
维姬（艾什利?康宁斯饰）被佩斯市的一对连环杀手绑架，为了求生，她试图破坏这对情侣的关系。这个角色来自澳大利亚作家兼导演本?扬的《爱的猎犬》，《卫报》称，这是一部"令人毛骨悚人的恐怖片"。这个"关于郊区变态情侣的故事剧情紧张激烈、令人胆寒，能轻松当选今年上映的最恐怖电影。"变态情侣由蒂芬?库里和艾玛?布斯扮演。导演扬关注了女性杀人犯的动机，以及关于破坏性的情感的心理剧，带给人们的冲击不亚于《巴巴杜》或《雪镇狂魔》。
（City of Ghosts）
《幽灵城》
Matthew Heineman follows his Oscar-nominated Cartel Land with what the Guardian has called "the definitive contemporary documentary about the tragedy of Syria, as well as an epoch-defining piece on modern media tactics". Following the citizen journalist collective Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently as they attempt to expose human rights violations by ISIS in their home country, the film "reveals accurate information as the first weapon of resistance", according to Canada's Globe and Mail. Heineman combines footage from RBSS - which sends reports of daily events behind enemy lines from anonymous correspondents still living there - with his own interviews at Turkish and German safe houses, and according to the Hollywood Reporter offers "a double portrait of devastation, of a truly destroyed city and of partially decimated survivors".
《卫报》称马修?海涅曼的《幽灵城》"无疑是一部关于叙利亚悲剧的当代纪录片，同时也是一部在现代媒体技术方面具有划时代意义的作品"。此前，海涅曼凭借《贩毒之地》获得奥斯卡提名。据加拿大《环球邮报》介绍，《幽灵城》主要讲述了民间记者组织"拉卡人民正被悄悄屠杀"（RBSS）为曝光极端组织伊斯兰国在叙利亚侵害人权的行为所做出的努力，这部电影告诉我们，"准确的信息是奋起反抗时的第一法宝"。生活在那里的RBSS匿名记者们深入敌后将每天的新闻发送出来。海涅曼将RBSS的视频影像和他在土耳其及德国避难所进行的采访结合在一起，《好莱坞报道》称该片"从两个视角纪录了一场灾难、一个被摧毁的城市以及部分大屠杀幸存者"。
China's property prices fell for a third straight month in July, as demand wanes and lenders propping up the market pull back.
今年7月，中国房地产价格连续第3个月下跌，因为需求在减弱，而支撑房地产市场的银行也削减了房贷业务。
New home prices across 70 cities tracked by the government fell by an average 0.9 per cent between June and July, the sharpest tumble in three straight declines, according to a weighted average calculated by Reuters. In June prices fell half a per cent.
路透(Reuters)计算的加权平均值显示，6月至7月，政府跟踪的70个大中城市的新房均价环比下降0.9%，为三次连续下跌中的最大降幅。6月，房价环比下降0.5%。
Sixty four of the 70 cities saw monthly prices fall, versus just 55 in June.
在70个大中城市中，7月房价下降的城市有64个，6月仅为55个。
From a year ago nationwide prices were up just 2.5 per cent, slowing from a pace of 4.2 per cent in June and 5.6 per cent in May. Back in January, annual prices had been climbing at 9.6 per cent.
与去年同月相比，全国房价升幅仅为2.5%，慢于6月的4.2%和5月的5.6%。今年1月，70个大中城市新建住宅销售价格同比上升9.6%。
Home prices in Beijing decelerated 1 per cent in the month - the first such decline in more than two years - cooling the annual change from 6.4 to 4 per cent. In Shanghai prices fell 1.2 per cent in the month, pushing the annual pace down from 7 to 4.1 per cent.
7月北京房价下降1%，为两年多来首次出现如此降幅，同比涨幅由6.4%下降至4%。7月上海房价下降1.2%，推动同比涨幅由7%下降至4.1%。
Consumer prices in mainland China rose 1.8 per cent year-on-year in July, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, down slightly from June’s growth of 1.9 per cent and matching a median estimate of 1.8 per cent from economists surveyed. In month-on-month terms, consumer prices returned to growth with a rise of 0.2 per cent.
中国国家统计局数据显示，7月份中国内地居民消费价格指数(CPI)同比上涨1.8%，涨幅较6月份的1.9%有所回落，与经济学家们的估计值的中位数相符。环比而言，7月份的CPI上涨了0.2%。
Price moves for foodstuffs – a key driver of changes in the headline figure – helped keep the gauge in check, as inflation for food, tobacco and liquor fell about one percentage point to to 2.8 per cent growth year-on-year.
食品价格的变动幅度在一定程度上抑制了整体CPI的涨幅（食品价格是影响整体CPI变化的关键因素之一），7月份食品烟酒价格同比上涨2.8%，涨幅较上月下降了大约1个百分点。
A rise in pork prices of 16.1 per cent for the period pushed up the headline figure by 0.42 percentage points. Unusually, the bureau did not give an independent figure on the contribution from a 4.3 per cent rise in vegetable prices, instead combining it with that of eggs and stating those categories had together contributed 0.11 percentage points to the gauge’s overall rise.
7月份，猪肉价格同比上涨16.1%，影响整体CPI同比上涨约0.42个百分点。鲜菜价格同比下降4.3%，但国家统计局罕见地没有公布这项本身对CPI的影响，而是将其与蛋类合并到一起，表示这两类合计影响整体CPI下降约0.11个百分点。
Despite deceleration in the headline gauge, core inflation, which strips out both food and energy prices, rose 0.2 percentage points to 1.8 per cent year-on-year, thanks in part to a continued and steady rise in healthcare costs, which were up 4.3 per cent for the period.
虽然7月份整体CPI涨速放缓，但剔除食品和能源价格的核心CPI同比上涨1.8%，涨幅较上月高了0.2个百分点。这在一定程度上是由医疗保健价格继续稳步上涨所致，7月份医疗保健价格同比上涨4.3%。
Producer prices fell 1.7 per cent in year-on-year terms last month, easing visibly from contraction of 2.6 per cent in June and coming in softer than a median estimate of -2 per cent from economists. In monthly terms prices returned to marginal growth with a rise of 0.2 per cent.
7月份，生产者出厂价格(PPI)同比下降1.7%，降幅较6月份的2.6%明显收窄，比经济学家们估计值的中位数2%也要小一些。环比而言，PPI恢复小幅上涨，涨幅为0.2%。
Chinese business sentiment fell sharply in July, suggesting that recent dramatic falls in company share prices had severely dented optimism.
7月份，中国企业信心显著降低，说明近期公司股价大幅下跌严重削弱了企业的乐观情绪。
The MNI China Business Indicator fell 8.8 per cent to 48.8 in July, below the 50 score which marks optimism. The reading matches the April level, which was the lowest since January 2009. In June the index had jumped 7.6 per cent in June to 53.5.
MNI中国企业信心指数(MNI China Business Indicator)在7月下降了8.8，降至48.8，低于50这一分水岭。50以上代表企业对前景持乐观态度。7月份的数字跟4月份相仿，4月份的数字为2009年1月以来的最低值。6月份，该指数曾上升7.6，至53.3。
MNI, a part of Deutsche B爀猀攀 Group, surveys 200 companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. It said the overall fall in sentiment outstripped actual recorded declines in production and new orders, suggesting that other factors were at play. The likeliest is the the steep decline in Chinese stock markets, which wipe some $3tn off the market cap of the two exchanges. The weakening also comes in spite of the recent stimulus measures implemented by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, amid deflationary pressures and rising labour and regulation costs.
MNI是德意志交易所集团(Deutsche B爀猀攀 Group)的分支机构，该机构调查了在沪市和深市上市的200家企业。MNI表示，总体信心的下降幅度高于产量和新订单实际录得的降幅，表明还有其他因素在发挥作用。最有可能的因素是中国股市的暴跌，它导致沪深两市总市值蒸发了约3万亿美元。尽管面对通缩压力以及劳动力和监管成本的上升，中国央行近期推出了一些刺激措施，但中国企业信心还是在变弱。
It's not only Chinese businesses feeling pessimistic after the recent market turmoil. A survey of consumer confidence for July just hit a record low.
近期股市动荡之后，感到悲观的不仅仅是中国企业。调查显示，7月份中国消费者信心创下新低。
The ANZ-Roy Morgan China consumer confidence index fell 2.5 per cent this month to 141, the lowest score since the index was created in January 2014.
7月份，澳新银行-罗伊椠根中国消费者信心指数(ANZ-Roy Morgan China consumer confidence index)下降2.5，至141，为2014年1月该指数创建以来的最低水平。
While many economists have said the stock market is divorced from the real economy, which should limit the effect of sharp declines on the real economy, the survey would suggest consumers were spooked.
尽管许多经济学家表示中国股市与实体经济关系不大——这应该会限制股市大跌对实体经济的冲击——但调查表明，消费者受到了惊吓。
Respondents who said it is a 'good time' to buy major items declined to 37.0 per cent, down 4.7 points from June. Those who said it was a 'bad time' to buy edged up to 8 per cent.
表示目前购买大件商品“正逢其时”的受访者比例降低至37%，较6月低了4.7个百分点。表示目前“不适合”购买大件商品的受访者比例升高到了8%。
This could make sense. For even though the percentage of household wealth in the China equity market is low — about 15 per cent of household financial assets are in equities, per HSBC — the full-throttle response to the falling stock market was perceived by many to be panicky. The number of people who lost wealth in the 30 per cent sell-off might be small, in other words, but the damage to Beijing's credibility could have far-reaching effects.
这可能是合乎情理的。原因是，尽管中国家庭只将一小部分财富投入到股市中——汇丰(HSBC)数据显示，股票占中国家庭金融资产的比例约为15%——但许多人认为，政府全力应对股市下跌表明政府对形势感到恐慌。换言之，在股市大跌30%中损失财富的人数或许不多，但中国政府声誉受到的伤害可能有着深远影响。
ANZ's Li-Gang Liu was optimistic that confidence would pick back up, however, as stocks stabilise and the authorities ease further in the months ahead.
然而，澳新银行的刘利刚乐观地认为，随着股市企稳、以及当局在未来几个月里推出更多宽松措施，消费者信心会回升。
"The market correction in the past few weeks should be viewed as a timely warning, allowing share prices to return to a level reflecting their underlying values," he said. "In addition, it offered market participants and regulators an invaluable lesson on risk and rational investing. We believe that the stock market rout has yet to become a systemic risk."
“过去几周的市场回调应被看成一次及时的警告，可使股价回到反映其内在价值的水平。”他说，“另外，它也为市场参与者和监管者上了关于风险和理性投资的宝贵一课。我们认为，此次股市动荡尚未演化为系统性风险。”
It's not just exports that are troubling the Chinese economy.
中国经济遭遇的麻烦不仅仅来自出口。
New data show industrial production slowed in July to a year-on-year pace of 6 per cent, its weakest since April and down from 6.8 per cent in June (which was its best reading since December). Economists had anticipated a pace of 6.6 per cent.
新公布的数据显示，7月份中国规模以上工业增加值同比增长6%，这是今年4月以来的最弱增长，也低于6月份6.8%的增幅（该增幅是去年12月以来的最大增幅）。经济学家原本预计7月份会增长6.6%。
Retail sales grew at a 10.5 per cent pace, missing forecasts and falling from the 10.6 per cent pace in June.
社会消费品零售总额同比增长10.5%，也没有达到预期，并且低于6月份的10.6%。
Also, fixed-asset investment—which includes spending on infrastructure, factory equipment and property construction—weakened back towards the 14-year low seen two months prior. The year-to-date pace fell from 11.4 per cent in May to 11.2 per cent last month, missing forecasts that it would rise to 11.5 per cent.
此外，中国固定资产投资（包含基础设施、工厂设备和房地产建设方面的开支）同比增幅从5月份的11.4%跌至上个月的11.2%，而预期值是11.5%。
The figures offer more evidence of a renewed slowdown in China's economy. An earlier reported slowdown in exports was widely cited as a key reason persuading the People's Bank of China to change the way it values the renminbi, resulting in a 4 per cent depreciation in the currency this week. The PBoC has said it acted to give more voice to markets.
这些数据为中国经济新一轮放缓提供了更多证据。此前有关出口放缓的报道，被广泛视为促使中国央行改变人民币汇率中间价形成机制的重要原因。新机制导致人民币汇率在本周贬值了4%。中国央行表示，它这么做是为了让市场发挥更大作用。
The manufacturing purchasing managers’ index published by the National Bureau of Statistics fell to 49.9 in June, below the 50-point line delineating growth from contraction for the first time in four months. That was just a hair below a consensus forecast from economists of 50 that would have meant activity neither rose nor fell compared to the previous month.
据中国国家统计局(NBS)公布数据，7月制造业采购经理指数(PMI)降至49.9，四个月来首次落于荣枯线以下。该数据微微低于经济学家此前预计的50(意味着制造业活动较上一月既没有上升也没下降)。
In an explanatory note the bureau suggested the primary factor behind the fall was a particularly strong El Nino effect, pointing to heavy rains and flooding in most of China’s provinces, particularly those along the Yangtze River Basin, which had impacted production (down 0.4 percentage points to 52.1) and transportation, among other things. But it also acknowledged a marked backslide in market demand.
中国国家统计局在数据解读中表示，本月回落主要原因是受超强厄尔尼诺现象影响，中国大部分地区，特别是长江流域遭遇强降雨及洪涝灾害，生产及运输等受到影响，本月生产指数回落0.4个百分点，至52.1。但该机构也承认市场需求明显放缓。
Economic stimulus continued to chiefly benefit large-scale enterprises, where PMI came in at 51.2, up 0.2 percentage points from June. Mid-sized and smaller enterprises both saw activity contract more severely with readings of 48.9 and 46.9 for the period respectively.
经济刺激政策的受益者仍主要为大型企业，其PMI指数为51.2，比6月份上升0.2个百分点；中、小型企业PMI指数分别为48.9和46.9，显示其活动收缩加重。
The official non-manufacturing PMI, which covers services but also includes some old-growth industries such as construction, came in at 53.9 in June, climbing further above the 50-point line.
7月官方非制造业PMI为53.9，在荣枯线之上进一步攀升。非制造业PMI不仅涵盖服务业，还包括建筑业等一些传统增长行业。
A sub-index for business activity in the services industry rose 0.4 percentage points from June to 52.6, which the bureau attributed to marked growth in rail and air logistics, telecommunications, information and technology, foreign exchange finance, capital market services, and leasing and business services.
服务业商务活动指数比6月上升0.4个百分点，达到52.6，中国国家统计局认为这是由于铁路和航空物流、电信、信息和技术、外汇融资、资本市场服务以及租赁商业服务的显著增长所致。
But non-manufacturing employment dropped another 0.2 percentage points to 48.5, indicating more job shedding. And China’s construction industry appeared to decelerate after revving up substantially in months prior, as a sub-index for the sector dropped to 61.1 in July, a marked fall from June’s reading of 62.
但非制造业就业人数又下降了0.2个百分点至48.5，表明用工量继续减少。中国的建筑行业在经过此前几个月的大幅加速后也出现减速，7月建筑业商务活动指数降至61.1，相较6月份的62有明显下降。
The official figures suggested things were grim for China’s manufacturing sector, but the latest edition of an independent activity gauge for the sector suggests they may be improving.
官方数据显示中国制造业状况严峻，但根据独立调研机构财新(Caixin)最新发布的数据，中国制造业可能有所提高。
The Caixin-Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for July rose above the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction with a reading of 50.6, up from 48.6 in June.
财新7月份PMI比6月份高了2个百分点，升至50.6，来到荣枯线上方。
The return to growth for the gauge, marking its highest reading since February 2015, comes as its official counterpart published by China’s National Bureau of Statistics has finally slipped into contraction after four months of respite.
这是财新PMI自2015年2月以来达到的最高水平，标志中国制造业恢复增长，但与国家统计局公布的数据出现背离。
The survey also showed output, buying activity and new orders all returned to growth as well, while a fall in new export orders suggested that growing demand was primarily domestic. However, companies surveyed said they had cut jobs in July for a fifth month running, if at a marginally slower rate.
财新的调查研究还表明产出、购买活动以及新订单都恢复增长，但新出口订单出现下降，这表明需求提高主要来自国内。不过受调查公司表示他们在7月份继续裁员，这已是连续第五个月用工量收缩，虽然收缩速度略微放缓。
Chinese property prices in July deflated for an 11th straight month in July, but the pace of decline was its slowest of 2015.
今年7月，中国房价连续第11个月下跌，不过跌幅是今年以来最小的。
New home prices in 70 cities fell by an average 3.7 per cent year-on-year last month, based on calculations by Reuters from official data published by China's National Bureau of Statistics. The results examine prices in 70 Chinese cities: in June they had fallen 4.9 per cent, in May they were down 5.7 per cent and in April they were down a record 6.1 per cent. July's deflation is the slowest since December.
路透社(Reuters)用中国国家统计局发布的官方数据计算得出的结果显示，上个月，中国70个城市的新房价格同比平均下跌3.7%。6月份，新房价格同比下跌4.9%，5月份同比下跌5.7%。4月份同比下跌6.1%，跌幅创了纪录。相比之下，7月份的跌幅是自去年12月以来最小的。
However prices have deflated for 11 straight months now, indicating signs of strain in the economy.
不过，目前中国房价已连续下跌11个月，显示出中国经济正承受着多么大的压力。
But there was some good news from the country's two biggest cities. In Beijing prices rose 1 per cent year-on-year, arresting a nine month streak of deflation, while in Shanghai prices rose 3.1 per cent year-on-year, a second month of increase.
但是，中国两个最大的城市也有好消息传出。北京的房价同比上涨1%，终止了持续9个月的下跌势头。上海的房价同比上涨3.1%，是连续第二个月上涨。
A Chinese court has banned the sale and import of most iPhone models in a stunning decision amid the trade war between the United States and China.
在美国和中国爆发贸易战之际，中国一家法院做出了一次惊人的裁决，禁止进口和销售7款iPhone机型。
The ban does not cover the new iPhone XS, iPhone XS Plus or iPhone XR, which were not yet available when Qualcomm filed its lawsuit.
这项禁令不包括新一代的iPhone XS、iPhone XS Plus以及iPhone XR，因为在高通提起诉讼时，这些手机尚未上市。
The phones covered by the ban make up about 10% to 15% of current iPhone sales in China, according to Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities.
韦德布什证券分析师丹尼尔·艾夫斯透露，这一禁令涵盖的手机约占目前iPhone在中国销量的10%至15%。
The court granted a pair of preliminary injunctions requested by Qualcomm, an American microchip maker. Qualcomm claims that Apple violates two of its patents in the iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X.
该法院批准了美国手机芯片制造商高通提出的两项临时禁令。高通声称苹果产品iPhone 6S、iPhone 6S Plus、iPhone 7、iPhone 7 Plus、iPhone 8、iPhone 8 Plus和iPhone X侵犯其两项专利。
The patents allow people to edit and resize photos on a phone and to manage apps by using a touchscreen, according to Qualcomm.
高通方面表示，这两项专利允许消费者在手机上编辑和调整照片，以及通过使用触摸屏管理应用程序。
The practical effect of the injunction is not yet clear. The ruling was announced publicly and put into effect last week, but Apple said in a statement that all iPhone models remain available in China.
这项禁令的实际效果尚不清楚。法院于上周公开宣布了这一裁决，并开始生效。但苹果方面在一份声明中表示，所有型号的iPhone仍在中国销售。
Qualcomm said in a statement that it would seek to enforce the injunction.
高通在一份声明中表示，将寻求强制执行禁令。

Some people seem like they were born to excel. They're gifted physically, intellectually or artistically, and it appears as if they just float to the top.
有些人似乎天生就很出色。他们在身体方面、智力上或是艺术方面天赋异禀，好像不费吹灰之力就可以拔得头筹。
But don't be fooled. However gifted someone may be, he or she still had to develop those talents to achieve a lofty professional position. And that's good news for the rest of us. Each one of us has our own skills and talents, and we too can develop them and propel ourselves into positions of influence.
不要再骗自己了。不管多么天资聪颖，一个人总要有某些实实在在的技能，才可以有高人一等的职业地位。这对我们来说可是好消息。我们每个人都有自己的技能和才华，我们也可以通过对它们的提升，让自己变得更有影响力。
Here are seven ways to enhance those talents:
以下是提高这些技能的7种方法：
1. Develop your critical decision-making skills
发展批判性的决策能力
Decision-making is a top leadership competency because it pops up everywhere, from the simple choice of where to hold a staff meeting to the strategic options of where to spend marketing dollars. These decisions impact the people in the next cubicle, but they may also affect a subsidiary halfway across the globe or an entire country.
我们在许多方面都需要做出决策：小到开会地点，大到销售费用的战略性分配，因此对领导者来说，最重要的就是决策能力。这些决定或许只是影响到你隔壁的人，又或许它会影响地球另一边的公司，甚至整个国家。
Decisiveness is not a trait we're born with -- it's a skill that can be learned. To master it, analyze your process of critical decision-making to spot weak links in your reasoning and to recognize unconscious biases for or against something or someone. While we can't control outcomes, we can shape the process that sets them in motion.
我们并非生来就能果断决策，但我们可以学着这样做。去分析你进行批判性决策的过程，看到你推理中的薄弱环节，并且认识到你潜意识里对某物或某人的偏见，这样你就会渐渐知道该怎么做。虽然结果并不在我们的掌控之中，但我们可以操作过程从而影响结果。
2. Learn to make a solid argument
学会有力地辩论
You may never address the United Nations Security Council or testify before Congress, but everyone should be able to put together a coherent argument. That skill is critically and frequently useful -- in high-stakes conversations, in presentations, in question-and-answer sessions and in other discussions with decision-makers or anyone else who represents a certain viewpoint or asks you to explain yours.
或许你从来没有在联合国安理会上发过言，也没有在国会里做过证，但是每个人都应该学会流畅清晰地表达。这种能力很重要。在进行高风险的对话的时候，在自我展示的时候，在问答环节，在与其他决策者讨论的时候，还有在与观点不同者解释你的观点的时候……诸多场合你都有可能用到它。
To argue means to give reasons. It means defending and promoting your choices against the contrary arguments of equally adept influencers. Take what you've learned in school and build on that base with private instruction and directed reading on the relevant subject. You'll find that your ability to think critically and analyze others' arguments will dramatically increase your influence on their choices.
辩论意味着给出理由。辩论时，面对与你观点对立、难分高下的对手，你要攻守兼备。在运用学校知识的基础之上，形成自己的思路，直接引用相关的论点。这样的话，你会发现这种批判性思考和分析他人论点的能力在很大程度上会增强你的影响力。
3. Become a storyteller
善于讲故事
Storytelling has been a premier tool in influencing people across cultures and eras. Influencers tell stories for strategic purposes. From motivating people to act, to teaching, to reducing resistance and changing minds, a well-told narrative is a formidable force, often far more powerful than the mere recitation of complex financial or technical facts.
要想影响那些不同文化或不同时代的人，讲故事是首要的办法。为了达到战略目的，有影响力的人常常会讲故事。一段精彩的故事叙述可以激励人们行动，传授人们知识，消解敌人的抵抗，改变他人的心意——它往往具有不可战胜的力量，比单调复杂的金融和技术详述强大得多。
Numbers and figures are important, but when it comes to showing their relationship to any issue, large or small, a strategic narrative wrapped around the digits will deliver the message better and more memorably than anything else.
数字和图表确实重要，但是要想展现它们与或大或小的问题的联系的时候，来一段巧妙的故事叙述无疑会让信息传递事半功倍。
After you master the data, ask yourself: Is there a way to put a human face on my message? Are there real-life examples that will help me make my point in a way others can relate to?
在你熟悉这些数据之后，试着问问自己：如何才使这些信息更为人性化？有没有现实例子可以让我的观点与之联系起来的？
4. Hone your speaking skills
培养说话的艺术
When many of us think of influential people, we often think of those who were great speakers, such as John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and Steve Jobs, as well as contemporaries such as Michelle Obama and Sheryl Sandberg. While many influencers operate effectively behind the scenes, those with the ability, the drive and the courage to speak persuasively have an additional source of powerful leverage.
每当谈及有影响力的人，我们常常想到那些演说家，像约翰?F?肯尼迪（John F. Kennedy），罗纳德?里根（Ronald Reagan）和史蒂芬?乔布斯（Steve Jobs），还有当代的米歇尔?奥巴马（Michelle Obama）和雪莉?桑德伯格（Sheryl Sandberg）。诚然，很多有影响力的人在幕后都很精干，但是那些有能力、有激情、有勇气去演讲的人都拥有一种额外的影响力。
Like decision-making skills, speaking skills are in high demand. Every day in myriad organizations, corporations and schools, vast numbers of presenters strive to capture the imaginations of workers and executives and students in order to drive an agenda forward. Yet many people fear speaking in public, giving in to a panic that closes a heavy door on a fast track to success and influence.
跟决策能力一样，有影响力的人也需要说话的艺术。每天，在无数个组织、公司和学校里，为了将一个工作提上日程，都有无数的发言者千方百计想要用言语征服工人、高管和学生们。然而，很多人不敢在公众面前说话。殊不知，这样的胆怯就是阻截了通向成功和强大影响力的捷径。
Do not shy away from speaking opportunities. Hone your message and delivery skill by repeatedly putting yourself in front of an audience, gather feedback, make adjustments, rinse and repeat. Summon the courage to speak and accept discomfort as a natural part of learning and growing. Start in smaller settings first, and then build up from there. There's no limit to where your influence can grow with this skill.
有发言机会的时候，尽管站出来吧。不断地将自己置身于公众面前，观察他们的反应并据此作出调整，反复打磨自己，这样才能锻炼你的口才。勇敢地开口，那些紧张不安的感觉只是你学习成长中的必经之路。千里之行，始于足下。尽管说出你的想法，你的潜能将无可限量。
5. Have a basic understanding of current events
对时事有所了解
You can't have an intelligent conversation with your peers and clients if you're stumped when faced with everyday topics such as the election, taxes, budget deficits, interest rates, markets, unemployment and the meaning of all these things to the average citizen. You don't need to be an expert on these topics, but you do need a basic understanding of them.
试想你跟同僚或者客户谈到时事，例如选举、税收、财政赤字、银行利率、市场、失业等等平民话题，这时候你却支支吾吾、面色尴尬，那你们还怎么高兴的交谈？对于这些信息，你不用有什么深刻见地，但如果一无所知，那就不应该了。
Influence is about shaping opinion, and embarrassing holes in everyday knowledge -- the kind that force you to awkwardly steer conversations into friendlier waters -- can significantly dampen your 360-degree influencing efforts. To fill these gaps, set aside a particular time each day to learn what's in the news. Make it a daily habit. It will require no more than 20 minutes.
所谓影响力就是形成你自己的观点。如果你在某些常识上有漏洞，或者当与别人谈到某件事，你被迫尴尬地主动转移话题，那在别人眼里，你的影响力可就大打折扣了。为了弥补这些不足，你应该养成良好的习惯，学着每天挤出一点时间来关注一下时事——不用很长，20分钟足矣。
Test your knowledge and wit by engaging friends and colleagues in the salient topics of the day and see how far you get and whether you're able to make a well-informed point that you can back up. It's a low-risk strategy that allows you to gather feedback in real time with the opportunity to fill gaps just as quickly, with hundreds of news sources just a few clicks away on your smartphone.
你可以通过跟同事朋友聊些日常话题来检验自己了解的多少，以及自己能否提出深刻的观点并说得有理有据。这种方式很安全，你可以在现实中得到反馈，你有机会用智能手机搜集到几百条新闻，以尽快弥补自己的知识缺陷。
Build your knowledge incrementally and notice how others will start coming to you for information, which is, after all, a major source of influence.
逐步增加你的知识储备，然后别人自然而然会靠近你以获取信息，这就是影响力的主要来源。
6. Think like a leader
像领导者一样思考
Influence is most obvious when it happens at the front of the pack. While influence can arise from any position, it is also from a position of leadership that it can make the most impact.
当一个人成为领军人物，他的影响力是最明显的。不过任何职位的人都可以产生影响力，而对领导者来说，他的力量影响的范围最大。
The most successful companies develop their high-potential leaders from within. If you're lucky enough to work for a leadership-development powerhouse such as GE, IBM or P&G, you've got it made, because everyone else is going to woo you to come on board with them and practice what you've learned.
最成功的公司往往从内部筛选及培养高潜能的领导者。如果你有幸在一个领导者的摇篮工作，比如美国通用电气公司（GE）、美国国际商用机器公司（IBM）或者宝洁公司（P&G），那你就胜利在望了。因为那里的每个人都希望与你成为合作伙伴，你会有很多锻炼自我的机会。
If you don't work for one of those great firms, if your company simply doesn't have the resources or if you're just out of school, volunteer to head up something such as a community project, a fundraiser or anything where you can test your mettle for making difficult decisions, setting strategy and motivating people toward a goal while keeping an eye on available resources.
如果你没能在这些大公司工作，或者你的公司并没有这些资源，又或者你的学历不够，那就自愿地去领导一件事情，比如一个社区项目或者一个资金筹集活动——只要这件事情可以让你知道在有限的资源前提下，自己在决策难题、运用谋略和调动他人积极性方面究竟有多大能耐，那都是可以的。
Volunteering is an excellent start for leadership training, as is mentoring others and helping them achieve their goals. The number-one leadership rule to keep in mind: help others become successful! Your altruistic efforts are sure to influence decision-makers around you to pencil you in for a bigger job when the opportunity comes along.
参与志愿活动是锻炼领导能力的良好开端，因为这是一个指导、帮助别人达到目标的过程。要记住这个首要的领导法则：让别人变得更成功！无私地帮助别人吧，等到时机成熟，决策者一定会升你的职。
7. Understand communication technology
了解信息技术
It's the 21st century, and even 5 year olds know about Twitter, Facebook and the latest multimedia platforms. Social media have secured a big foothold and they're here to stay. If you don't have an ongoing online dialogue with your customers or if you need a 19 year old to show you the ropes every time you log on to your website's forum, you're behind.
现在是21世纪，即使是5岁小孩子也听过推特、脸书等等新潮的多媒体。社交媒体已经站稳了脚跟，并且将会继续发展。如果你现在还没有与客户进行网上对话，或者你还需要一个19岁的青年来教你如何点开论坛的注册链接，那你就落伍啦。
Business is online, and customers and recruiters are looking for you to be present. Google yourself right now, and if the search produces 25 other people with your name -- but not you -- it's time to dive in headfirst. For the majority of people with whom you'll come in contact, your reputation and perceived influence start with what they can find about you on the Internet.
如今的商业都在网上进行。客户和聘用方都希望能在网上联系到你。试着搜索一下自己名字。如果搜索结果显示有25个人与你同名，但其中没有你，那你可得卯足劲努力了。因为对你的大多数同伴来说，他们对你的名声和个人影响力第一判断来自于网上搜索的结果。
Each individual, even those gifted people who seem to float easily to corporate heights, need to work on the skills that enable and enhance influence. If you develop these competencies, you will watch your influence soar.
那些有天赋的人似乎轻而易举就可以成功。但是包括他们在内的所有人都要努力学习这些技能，这样才可以提高个人影响力。如果你具备了这些技能，那你的影响力会迅速飙升了。

“Reality leaves a lot to the imagination.” - John Lennon
"现实总是留给想象极大的空间"-----约翰 列侬
How many times have we told ourselves in complete earnestness, “I'm going to be more organized and productive from now on.”？ Or that the diet starts tomorrow? Or that we're going to make a real effort to exercise now?
多少次我们曾坚定地对自己说"从现在开始我要活得更有规划，更有成就"?从明天起开始减肥？或者开始努力锻炼身体？
Only to have that enthusiasm fizzle away, and all our best intentions come to nothing?
那种热情是否很快就消失了，而我们的目标也完全没有实现呢？
It's the most common thing in the world （besides bacteria） — the honest and fervent desire for self-improvement, followed by inaction or giving in to temptations, followed by guilt or giving up. Bridget Jones captured it best, writing her constant resolutions into her diary. “Will definitely go to the gym this afternoon.” Only to be followed by a binge of pastries followed by drinking and smoking.
世界上最常见的事莫过于，当初诚挚而热烈地追求自我发展目标，而后却由于懒怠和经不住诱惑而放弃，最终内疚不已。布丽琪特对此体会最深，她在日记中经常写到自己的决定“今天下午一定要去体育馆”，然而最终却以狂欢派对，喝酒，抽烟取而代之。
We're all Bridget Jones. It happens to the best of us. It's inertia at work, mixed with a bit of laziness as well as the very human trait of giving in to desires despite all the good intentions in the world.
我们都是布丽琪特。尽管我们有很多美好的目标，但由于在工作中的惯性，懒惰，和对诱惑的妥协，这类事情常常发生在我们身上。
1. Get moving, a bit at a time. Inertia is beat only by movement. Once you get going, momentum builds up and inertia is no longer a factor. So the key is to get started, and you do that not by trying to go from 0 to 60 in 5 seconds, but by trying to go from 0 to 5mph in a day or two. That's doable. It's all about baby steps. Once you get going, you're golden.
采取行动，每次进步一点。唯有行动可以击败惯性。一旦你行动起来，动力就会源源而来，惯性也不再成为问题了。所以关键在于着手开始干，这并不是说你在五分钟内重复60次，而是说要努力在一两天内重复5次。这只是第一步，一旦你开始行动，你就成功了一半。

1. Apply Full Make-Up
Okay, look. Refreshing your lip gloss after a meal is one thing, but putting your whole face on while riding the bus or subway (where no one should do any proposing!) is so not cool. Set your alarm ten minutes earlier, and do your makeup before you leave your apartment. A woman has to retain a little mystique, you know.
化妆。
饭后给自己涂口红，在公交车上化妆，都是不文雅的行为，最好每天早起10分钟，在家里化好妆再出门。
201001/94091.shtml
2. Adjust Your Skimpy Underwear
If it’s so uncomfortable in the first place that you have to go digging in places you really shouldn’t, maybe it’s time to switch to underwear with a little more coverage, hmm?
选择宽松的内衣
宽松的内衣可以让你舒舒服服地过一天。

4. Show Off Your Midriff
I don’t care if you’ve got washboard abs, if you could bounce a quarter of your belly, or if you’re only sixteen. Unless you’re on the beach, at the pool, or working for tips, no one, I mean no one, should be running around with an exposed midriff. It’s just not classy.
不要露着肚皮
除非在沙滩，游泳池，否则不要露着自己的肚皮在外，并不时尚。
201001/94091.shtml
5. Talk on Your Phone in a Public Bathroom or Dressing Room
Bathrooms and dressing rooms are sort of like Vegas. What happens in them should stay in them, and you with your phone broadcasting every sound to God knows who and subjecting the rest of us to some inane conversation that can absolutely wait until you no longer have your pants around the ankles is not honoring that sacred code.
不要在公厕讲电话。
201001/94091.shtml
6. Ask Your Partner or Spouse If They Love You
It’s uncomfortable for them; it’s uncomfortable for us. Save your strange pillow talk for when you’re horizontal.
不要在公共场合问自己的爱人是否爱自己。
201001/94091.shtml
7. Tweeze Errant Hairs or Pop a Pimple
While I understand the temptation of removing any evidence that you’re less than perfect, doing so in public not only underscores your imperfections, it makes you look, well, kinda nasty.
不要在公众场合拨弄自己的头发或挤痘痘，这样看上去很邋遢。
201001/94091.shtml
8. Criticize Your Partner or Spouse
Sure, they may deserve it—especially if they’re treating a waitress like crap or ogling other people, but there’s a time and a place for everything, and in public when everyone can hear your private conversation is not it.
不要与别人大吵大闹。
201001/94091.shtml
9. Adjust the Girls
We’ve all been there before: a breast slips below your underwire or heads too closely to your armpit, but until you find a private spot, resist the urge to reach into your bra and readjust.
整理自己的内衣。很多时候，内衣会不经意地滑落，记住去一个没人的角落，悄悄地弄好。
201001/94091.shtml
10. Pee All Over the Toilet Seat
If you do happen to have bad aim, remember the old adage: If you sprinkle when you tinkle, please be neat and wipe the seat!
不要将公厕马桶弄脏。如果你不小心弄脏了，记住清理干净。
(可可英语版权所有,未经允许请勿转载)
201001/94091.shtml1. Wash your hair at least every other day. 至少要每隔一天洗一次头发。
A girl loves a boy who smells nice, and cares about his image. Besides, greasy hair is not a good look on anybody, even if they look like Brad Pitt. By taking care of your hair, you at least show that you're interested in your appearance and care enough about yourself to take good care of yourself.
女孩喜欢身上气味不错的男孩子，而且挺在乎他的形象。况且，油头在任何人身上都不好看，即使他们长得像布拉德皮特。护理好你的头发至少表明你在乎你的外形，而且花了不少心思照顾好自己。
201001/94358.shtml
2. Make sure you have good hygiene. 一定要做好个人卫生。
· Brush twice a day 一天刷两次牙
· If your face is clean shaven, shave regularly. Stubble, when it's not intentionally there, promotes a look of unkempt.
如果你的脸是刮得比较干净的，那么要定期刮。不是刻意蓄的短胡渣会给人带来一种不整洁的印象。
· Wash your face every day. This helps to clear up whiteheads/blackheads, as well.
每天洗脸。这会帮你去除脸上的“白头”或者“黑头”。
201001/94358.shtml
3. Be confident in yourself. 充满自信。
Girls love guys who are confident, and confidence is also the key to getting ahead in the business world. Unless you believe in yourself, you can't sell yourself, so less people will believe in you. Remember, though, that there is a line between confidence and arrogance. Arrogance is not sexy.
女孩喜欢自信的男人，而且自信也是商场中拼搏的关键。除非做到相信自己，不然你就不能推销自己，那样相信你的人会更少。但是请记住，自信和自负是有界限的。自负并不性感。
201001/94358.shtml
4. Wear nice clothes. 穿好一点。
The style of clothes that you wear doesn't matter, because you're expressing your personality. Whatever you choose to wear, though, should be clean. Also do not wear pants that show a lot of boxer. This is not sexy. It is gross to almost all girls. If you are going to wear jeans, make sure they are not too baggy. This does not look good.
你穿什么款式无所谓，因为你有你的个性。但无论穿什么，你的衣服必须是干净的。不要穿很皱的裤子，这也不性感，基本上女生都会讨厌。如果你要穿牛仔裤，不要穿那种口袋太多的，那也不好看。
201001/94358.shtml
5. Be funny! 搞笑一点！
A girl loves a guy who can genuinely make her laugh. If you notice she is being turned off by your sense of humor (which you will be able to tell by her body language) then stop. Give her space.
女孩喜欢能真正逗乐她们的男人。如果你发觉她对你的幽默感不感冒（你可以从她的肢体语言中察觉），那么见好就收。给她足够空间。

7. If a girl does not give you a response, don't take it to heart--remain cool and think of your future with a new girl.
如果某一个女孩不给你答复，不要放在心上——保持冷静，想想自己和另一个女孩的未来。
201001/94358.shtml
8.Different time frames for hair-washing apply to different people. If your hair is dirty and greasy between times when you wash it, make it a habit to wash it more often. Likewise, if you don't need to wash your hair every other day, don't feel like you have to anyway.
不同的人适用不同的洗头频率。假如你的头发在前后两次洗头中间这段时间又脏又油的话，养成一个更勤洗头的习惯。同样地，如果你觉得不需要每隔一天洗次头，那就不必那样做了。
201001/94358.shtml
9.If you're trying to get a girlfriend talk to them. Say "hi" and start a conversation. She will most likely talk to you if you start a conversation.
如果想找女朋友，就找她们说话。以打招呼开头。如果你先说，她基本上会予以配合。
201001/94358.shtml
10.Remember to check out the whole grade. There are some girls out there that are awesome and just aren't so popular. They would love some attention. And they don't expect so much so you can be more relaxed.
记得搜索整个年级的女生。有一些不是很显眼的女生其实非常不错。她们也许需要一些关注，但不会期待太多，所以你追求起来更轻松。
201001/94358.shtml
11.Realize that being truly sexy to someone often has little to do with how you look or smell. Being truly sexy comes through love and a relationship, which should never be based on physical characteristics.
注意：对某些人来说，真正的性感和你看起来或者闻起来怎样没多大关系，它来自爱和友谊，这些是不能建立在外在的东西上的。
201001/94358.shtml
12. Girls tend to stick together so don't be mean to one girl and expect another girl to love you.
女孩们喜欢黏在一起，因此不要既轻薄一个而又期待着另一个。
（可可英语版权所有,未经允许请勿转载）
201001/94358.shtml1. Pay with actual cash when you can. Credit cards are a major cause of overspending. When we whip out the plastic, our mind goes numb; we don't process the transaction the same visceral way we do when we spend cash. (Think of it like using poker chips in Vegas -- only without Wayne Newton tunes cranking through the sound system.) In fact, some experts say people spend 15% to 30% more when using credit instead of cash. Spending actual cash forces you to think about every dollar you spend, so you experience a physical reaction to forking over $1s and $5s.
尽可能用现金支付。信用卡鼓励提前消费。当我们刷卡的时候，我们不会在乎那些钱，换做是付现金就好很多。

2. Set up an instant no-brainer budget. The “envelope” budgeting approach will help you get in tune with your spending in a snap. The idea is that you carry around just the amount of cash you want to devote to various spending categories (lunch, entertainment, cute shoes) for that week. Try it for the first couple of weeks in January and see how it affects your purchasing. Chances are it'll keep you from frittering away your money so much so that you'll tell the whole family to play along.
做一个粗略的预算。例如，将每周做的预算放在一个信封里，任何花费只能从这个信封里抽取。
201001/93987.shtml
3. Keep your big wants/dreams in the forefront of your mind. Think of every financial decision in the context of your larger money goals (be it buying a new coat, paying cash for your next car, or securing your retirement). Before you toss a gossip magazine into your grocery cart while waiting in the checkout line or buy something just because it‘s on sale consider whether or not such purchases get you to that two-week cruise or covering Junior's college costs.
记清楚自己花钱的大项。在买娱乐杂志的时候，或一些细小的消费的时候，想想你是否有足够的钱去买新车，是否有足够的养老金。
201001/93987.shtml
4. Always shop with a list. It may be cliché, but shopping with a list will keep you honest. Studies show that as much as 60% of supermarket purchases are unplanned. With the average family shelling out $5,000 for groceries each year, that's $2,000 of unnecessary stuff running across the scanner.
购物前列一张清单。虽然看似繁琐，但是这样的清单可以让你合理购物。

201001/93987.shtmlChina's new middle class consists mainly of the post-80s generation, according to a survey conducted by zhaopin.com, a job recruitment website.
求职网站智联招聘近日开展的一项调查显示，我国新锐中产阶级主要由80后组成。
The study classifies those earning between 100,000 yuan and 500,000 yuan a year as middle class.
该研究将年薪10-50万元的人群定义为中产阶级。
Compared with other countries, those in the middle class in China are much younger and about 52% of the 49,989 participants were post-80s generation, said Guo Sheng, the CEO of Zhaopin.com.
智联招聘首席执行官郭盛称，相较其他国家，我国的中产阶级更年轻；49989名调查参与者中，约52%是80后。
Most of the survey participants found success in industries such as internet, finance and real estate.

Figures showed that 38% of the participants came from first-tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Guo added.
郭盛还表示，数据显示，38%的调查参与者来自北京、上海、广州、深圳等一线城市。
The survey also revealed that salary accounted for 93% of their total income and paying for loans, shopping and children's education occupied the top three daily expenses for China's middle class.
该调查还显示，工资占中产阶级总收入的93%；还贷、购物、子女教育占据我国中产阶级日常开销的前3名。
Meanwhile, about 95% of the participants said they felt anxious because they were not sure about their future and were concerned about inflation, food safety and property purchase restriction.
同时，95%的调查参与者表示会感到焦虑，因为他们对未来感到不确定，且对通胀、食品安全、房产限购感到担忧。
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced she is three months pregnant, and that she and her partner Clarke Gayford are expecting their first child by the middle of the year.
新西兰总理杰辛达·阿德恩日前宣布了自己已经怀孕三个月的消息，她和丈夫克拉克·盖福德将于今年年中迎来他们的第一个孩子。
"And we thought 2017 was a big year! Clarke and I are really excited that in June our team will expand from two to three, and that we'll be joining the many parents out there who wear two hats," she wrote on Facebook.
阿德恩在脸书上写道：“我们认为2017年是个丰收年！我和克拉克真的好兴奋，到6月份我们就会成一个三口之家了。我们也将成为身兼两职的父母了。”
Pakistan's Benizar Bhutto was the first elected world leader to become pregnant while in office, giving birth to her second child in 1990.
1990年，当时的巴基斯坦总理贝娜齐尔·布托在任期内生下了她的第二个孩子。
Ardern became New Zealand's prime minister on Oct. 26, 2017, making her the third woman to take the office in the country. She said she found out about her pregnancy on Oct. 13, days before it was announced she would take office.
阿德恩于2017年10月26日上任，是新西兰第三位女总理。她表示，自己在10月13日，也就是当选总理的前几天，发现自己怀孕了。
Ardern's deputy, Winston Peters, will be acting prime minister for the six weeks after Ardern has her child in June, New Zealand News website stuff.co.nz reports.
据新西兰新闻网站stuff.co.nz报道，在阿德恩6月生产之后休息的6个星期期间，副总理温斯顿·彼得斯将代行总理职责。
"At the end of my leave I will resume all Prime Ministerial duties," Ardern explained.
阿德恩解释称：“产假结束后，我会继续担任总理。”
A COUPLE who spend only 11 percent of their monthly wages have become a hot Internet topic among young Chinese.
一对夫妻每月只花11％的工资在中国年轻人之间已经成为了一个热门的互联网话题。
In an online post, Guo Hao said he and his wife, both in their 20s, save the majority of their income.
在网上的一个帖文中，郭昊说，他和他妻子，都是20多岁的，存下了他们大部分的收入。
"My wife and I earn 9,000 yuan (US$1,428) a month together. We only spend 1,000 yuan monthly and save about 90,000 yuan in a year," wrote Guo, living in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
“我和我妻子每月一共赚9000元的（US $1,428），我们每月只花1000元，一年内节余约90,000元，”郭写道，他生活在中国东部的江苏省省会南京。
The post drew a huge response online and questions about how he managed it. Guo published a detailed report of his family expenses to show how.
关于他是如何做到的这一点，这个帖子在网上引发了巨大的反响和讨论。郭发表了一份家庭开支的详细报告来说明是怎样做到的。
Guo, a state-owned enterprise employee, and his wife, a nurse, have lunch provided by their employers, buy discounted food when supermarkets are about to close and visit their parents' on weekends.
郭是一个国企员工，他的妻子是一名护士，他们中午在公司用餐，超市关门时去买打折食品，周末去他们父母家蹭饭。
They bought a small apartment with a loan covered by a government housing fund, meaning there is no extra expense. They live near work, which saves on transport costs, and buy clothes from street vendors and online shops.
他们买了一个小公寓，用政府住房公积金支付贷款，这意味着没有任何额外的花销。他们住在附近工作，从而节省了交通费用，并从街头小贩和网上小店那买衣服。
The Chinese are known for saving. However, driven by soaring rents and other living expenses, many young city-dwellers in China find it hard to save money. A nickname, "moonlight tribe," has been created for such people whose pockets are empty at the end of every month.
中国以节俭而众所周知。然而，由于飞涨的租金及其他生活开支，许多年轻的中国城市居民发现很难存下钱。一个“月光族”的绰号已经为那些月底时口袋里空空如也的人创造。
Guo's saving strategy has been the source for discussion. At Sina Weibo alone there are more than 480,000 entries on the topic.
郭节俭战略一直是讨论的源头。仅在新浪微博上就有超过48万条的回复。
Although many appreciated their lifestyle and have tried their ideas, some argued it is too extreme and comes at the cost of quality of life.
尽管许多人赞赏他们的生活方式，并尝试了他们的点子，但仍有一些人认为它过于极端，以生活质量为代价。
"What's the point of making money, if you can not enjoy a better life?" wrote a microblogger named BeipiaoEzu. "It is so exhausting to plan every expense meticulously just to save some money."
“赚钱的意义是什么，如果你不能享受更好的生活？”一个叫 BeipiaoEzu的微博用户写道， “这是如此地费尽心机去计划每一笔支出，只是为了省下一些钱。”
Xu Bin, 30, working at a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, told Xinhua that he spends about half of his 10,000 yuan monthly salary toward upkeep of three horses and goes riding almost every weekend.
许斌，30岁，在北京一家国有企业工作，他告诉新华社他花费万元月薪的一半养着三匹马，几乎每个周末去骑马。
Although his hobby leaves him short of money, Xu plans no change. "I am living a life I enjoy and don't want to sacrifice what I like for a number in a bank account," he said.
虽然他的爱好让他缺钱，徐没有改变计划。 “我过着喜欢的生活，我不想为了银行帐户里的一个数字牺牲我的爱好，”他说。
Others also question whether it is appropriate to rely on parents so much. "Dinners at the parents' house every weekend?" said microblogger Heideshanliang. "It is a bit shameful for adults, who are supposed to support their parents, to still depend on them financially."
其他人也质疑依赖父母那么多是否合适。 “每个周末在父母那吃饭？”“黑得闪亮”的微博用户说。 “这对成年人来说有点羞愧，他们应该奉养他们的父母，但却仍然在经济上依赖父母。”
啃老族 the NEET group
“啃老族”又称“尼特族”，“尼特族”是NEET的音译，全称是(Not currently engaged in Employment, Education or Training)，最早在英国使用，之后渐渐流传到其它国家；它是指一些不升学、不就业、不进修或参加就业辅导，终日无所事事的族群。在英国，尼特族指的是16至34岁的年轻人；在日本，则指的是15至34岁的年轻人。

闪居族 flash cohabitants
“闪居”即“闪电同居”的意思。在英语中，已经有一个词"cohabit"表示“同居”，那么“同居族”即为"cohabiters"，而“闪居族”就可译为"lightening cohabiters"。
201002/96180.shtml
穷忙族 the working poor
穷忙族来自英文单词"working poor"，原意是指那些薪水不多，整日奔波劳动，却始终无法摆脱贫穷的人。但随着“穷忙一族”队伍逐渐壮大，其主要的标准也成为每周工时低于平均工时的三分之二以下、收入低于全体平均60%以下者。这个定义又逐渐发展成一种为了填补空虚生活，而不得不连续消费，之后继续投入忙碌的工作中，而在消费过后最终又重返空虚的“穷忙”。换句话说，穷忙族并非失业者，有人可能兼了好几份差事，甚至全职受雇者都可能沦为既忙又穷的工作穷人。欧盟还将这群人细分成不同等级，提供不同的协助方案。
201002/96180.shtml
走班族 walking commuters
“走班族”是指为锻炼身体而放弃乘车，宁愿步行上下班的人。在英语中，"commuters"本来是指那些乘车上下班的人，但“走班”一词却无直接的词汇与其相对应。按照“走班族”所含的“本来可以坐车上下班，却选择步行的人”的含义，该词可译为"walking commuters"。
201002/96180.shtml
慢活族 slow walkers
“慢活族”的准确译文应该是"persons with slow-pace life"，但这种译法却使译文失去了词汇术语的特点。鉴于该词在英语中没有现成的词汇可以对译，我们不妨以象征的手法将该词译为"slow walkers"(行走步伐缓慢的人)，意为“追求生活慢节奏的人”。
201002/96180.shtml
飞鱼族 the flying fish
“飞鱼族”一词所表示的特定意义在英语中并未有现成的词汇与其对应，其它意译的方式也无法转达出该词的特定内涵，故将该词直译为"the flying fish"。“飞鱼族”指的是在国内已取得不俗成绩，但毅然放下一切，到国外名校求学的特殊中国群体。源自禹风写的一部小说《巴黎飞鱼》，既比喻跃出自己所熟稔的本国行业，试图在欧美天空飞翔的这一冒险举动，又比喻“本身是鱼，却一心想要飞”这种心态。
201002/96180.shtml
酷抠族 cool carls
“酷抠族”是人们对高学历、高收入却追求简朴生活方式的人的称谓。对于金钱和待人处事，他们并非真正意义上的“抠门”，故不宜将其直译为"cool miser"。根据该词的内涵，不妨将此词译为"cool carl"。这样，既有“酷”(cool)的超逸，也有凡人(carl)的简约，而且与“酷抠”在读音上也比较相近。
201002/96180.shtml
月光族 moonlight clan
“月光族”指将每月赚的钱都用光、花光的人，所谓洗光吃光，身体健康。“月光族”一般都是年轻一代，他们与父辈勤俭节约的消费观念不同，喜欢追逐新潮，扮靓买靓衫，只要吃得开心，穿得漂亮，根本不在乎钱财。同时，也用来形容赚钱不多，每月收入仅可以维持基本开销的一类人。这个词是一个中性词，没有绝对的褒贬义之分。
201002/96180.shtml
闪婚族 flash marriage group
“闪婚”，顾名思义是指迅速结合的闪电式婚姻。从其形成的过程来看，“闪婚”指的是两人在短暂的相识后，未经过一定时间的交往和相互了解而确立婚姻关系的一种快速的婚姻形式。“闪婚族”用最快的速度完成从恋爱、产生爱情到结婚的漫长过程，按媒体的描述就是“他们几秒钟可以爱上一个人，几分钟就能谈完一场恋爱，数小时内可以决定终身大事，一周便能踏上红地毯。”
201002/96180.shtml
波波族 bobos
波波，译自BoBo，指的是那些拥有较高学历、收入丰厚、追求生活享受、崇尚自由解放、积极进取的具有较强独立意识的一类人。BoBos一词源于美国编辑David Brooks根据其观察所得而写成的书《BoBos in Paradise》，是Bourgeois及Bohemian两词合并而成。

This time last year, the biggest early-day news about the renminbi appeared to be an announcement of a new, improved Rmb100 note to fight counterfeiting. It was until China’s central bank fixed the currency 1.9 per cent weaker than it had the previous day.
去年今日的早上，有关人民币的最大新闻似乎是有关新版100元面额人民币将有助于防伪的消息。随后传出一条更大的新闻：中国央行(PBoC)把人民币兑美元汇率中间价较前一日下调1.9%。
Traders were so stunned they initially thought there was something wrong with their hearing.
交易员们如此震惊，以至于他们最初以为自己的听力出了问题。
That change in the daily fix, around which the onshore renminbi trades 2 per cent either side, was five times the size of any fix move by the People’s Bank of China before then, and is still twice the size of any change since the turmoil it triggered.
那次人民币汇率中间价——在岸汇率每天波动幅度被限定在中间价上下2%的范围内——的降幅，是此前中国央行最大中间价调整幅度的5倍，并且仍是自那次调整引发动荡以来最大变动幅度的两倍。
One year on, the renminbi market is more or less calm once more as those speculating on further falls have either given up or found more profitable bets elsewhere.
一年后的今天，随着很多猜测人民币进一步下跌的人要么已经死心、要么找到了其他更有利可图的打赌对象，人民币市场差不多恢复了平静。
But that would not be the case without the events of last August, which forced the PBoC to communicate better, and taught many investors that alongside the old maxim “don’t fight the Fed” they should perhaps add another: “don’t push the PBoC”.
但是，如果没有去年8月那场风波，情况不会是现在的样子。那场风波迫使中国央行改进沟通，并使很多投资者领悟到：除了古老的格言“不要与美联储(Fed)对着干”以外，他们或许还应该再加上一条：“不要逼中国央行”。
“The motive [for currency reform] was right but they fumbled the process [last August], and they’ve learnt a lot since,” says David Mahon, chairman of Mahon Beijing Investment Management Advisors. “Western observers make too much of what they see as currency manipulation. This [suspicion] comes from a lack of understanding of the Chinese economy.”
“（汇改的）动机没错，但是（去年8月）他们搞砸了这个过程，自那以来他们学到了很多经验，”马鸿（北京）投资管理顾问公司(Mahon Beijing Investment Management Advisors)董事长马大伟(David Mahon)表示，“西方观察人士太过纠结于他们眼里的汇率操纵行为。这种（疑心）源自对中国经济缺乏理解。”
The PBoC’s increased willingness to communicate is the biggest change. On August 11th, the momentous fixing was accompanied by a very brief statement that talked only of a “one-time adjustment” and a shift — with no details — to a market-focused regime.
中国央行的沟通意愿增加是最大变化。去年8月11日的那次重大调整伴随着一份非常简短的声明，只表示此举是为了完善人民币市场化机制而进行的“一次性校正”和变动，没有细节。
That limited information prompted fears the depreciation was really a sign China’s economy was in far worse state than realised and that the PBoC’s control over capital flows could be cracking.
这一有限的信息促使外界担忧，那次贬值是中国经济比人们预想的要糟糕得多的一个标志，而中国央行对资本流动的管制可能正在出现裂缝。
They also worried that China was opening a new front in the currency wars, seeking competitive devaluation to bolster its exports.
他们还担心，中国正在汇率战争中开辟一条新战线，寻求竞争性贬值来提振出口。
“The market impact was clearly underestimated by policymakers,” says Mansoor Mohi-uddin, senior markets strategist at RBS. “They’ve had to change a lot since then.”
“政策制定者显然低估了对市场造成的冲击，”苏格兰皇家银行(RBS)高级市场策略师曼苏尔?莫希-乌丁(Mansoor Mohi-uddin)表示。“自那以来，他们不得不做出很大改变。”
Communications have developed in several steps. In December the PBoC began publishing the composition of the basket of currencies against which it tracks the renminbi. Analysts have since mostly concluded that the central bank does follow market pricing in setting the renminbi fix — at least, to a far greater degree than before, and so long as it suits it to.
沟通分几步发展。去年12月，中国央行开始公布其追踪人民币汇率时参考的一篮子货币的构成。自那以来，多数分析师得出的结论是中国央行在设定人民币中间价时确实在遵循市场定价——至少比以前在更大程度上遵循市场，而且只要这么做符合当局的意图。
Talking publicly was a bigger ask: except for a brief appearance in September, Zhou Xiaochuan, the PBoC governor, only broke silence in February, in a magazine interview. That only came following heavy criticism of January’s tumbling renminbi that in turn produced fresh global turmoil.
公开发表谈话则是更大的奢求：除了去年9月的一次短暂露面，中国央行行长周小川直至今年2月接受一家杂志采访时才打破沉默——这还是在1月人民币汇率大跌引发新一轮全球动荡、招致各方批评后才发生的。
“PBoC officials have stepped up their communication game,” says Frederic Neumann, head of Asian economic research at HSBC. “They [have] let investors understand that [currency reform] is about flexibility, not an opening shot in the global currency wars.”
“中国央行官员已经加强了他们的沟通，”汇丰(HSBC)亚洲经济研究主管范力民(Frederic Neumann)说，“他们（已经）让投资者明白（汇率改革）关乎弹性，而非打响全球汇率战的第一枪。”
The central bank has also demonstrated it is prepared to play hard ball. In January, heavy intervention in the offshore market hurt short-sellers and stemmed the renminbi’s fall. Meanwhile, new reserve requirements, imposed on offshore deposits for the first time, sent short-term renminbi borrowing rates in Hong Kong negative for a day by the end of March. The result was the renminbi ended the quarter stronger.
中国央行也证明了其已经准备好打硬仗。今年1月，对离岸市场的大举干预打击了空头，阻止了人民币下跌。与此同时，首次对离岸人民币存款执行新的准备金要求，使得香港短期人民币借款利率在3月底的一天跌至负值。其结果是人民币在结束第一季度之际走强。
Bearish bets now appear to have been rethought to the extent that last month, when the renminbi slipped to five-year lows, it was not met with anything like the same fevered reaction as last August.
看跌人民币的投机者似乎已改变主意，以至于上月人民币汇率跌至5年低点时，市场并未出现去年8月的那种激烈反应。
The PBoC’s actions have also made it clear that China maintains a strong grip on its capital account.
中国央行的举措也明确表明，中国依然有力管制着资本账户。
After its FX reserves fell by more than $100bn in both December and January, bolstering the case for renminbi bears, subsequent outflows slowed sharply amid reports China was tightening its controls in several ways.
在去年12月和今年1月，中国外汇储备分别下降逾1000亿美元，这支持了看跌人民币的理由。但随后资本外流急剧放缓，有报道称中国通过多种方式收紧管制。
Some of these enforced existing rules. While approval had always been needed from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange for big overseas acquisitions, there was now a sense that “you really had to have a deal worth prioritising above other outbound investments”, according to one source.
其中一些方式是执行现有规则。一位消息人士称，尽管大型海外收购始终需要获得中国国家外汇管理局(SAFE)的批准，但现在人们感觉，“你真的需要有一笔值得优先于其他对外投资的交易”。
New measures have also been brought in: from February, the PBoC started capping the transactions of mainlanders buying life insurance in Hong Kong to stop them from exploiting a loophole to move funds offshore.
中国还出台了新的措施：从今年2月开始，中国央行开始为内地人士在香港购买人寿保险的交易设置上限，以阻止他们利用漏洞向海外转移资金。
SAFE stopped allocating quotas allowing domestic investors to invest abroad, and stopped its launch of the second Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor scheme that allows domestic investors to buy equity abroad.
外管局不再向国内投资者授予海外投资额度，并停止开展第二批合格境内机构投资者(QDII)项目。QDII项目允许国内投资者在国外购买股票。
Officials also began encouraging big banks and would-be acquirers of foreign companies to borrow in dollars to create cash pools offshore rather than move existing renminbi.
官员们也开始鼓励大型银行和外国企业的潜在收购方借入美元以创建离岸资金池，而不是将现有人民币资金转移出去。
The final reason for the lack of recent upsets may simply be that other crises have emerged elsewhere.
最近没有风波的最后一个原因可能是全球其他地区爆发了其他危机。
“People have become distracted: global events such as Brexit have meant there’s less attention and scrutiny of the PBoC’s management of the renminbi,” says Mr Mahon.
马大伟表示：“人们已经分散了注意力：英国退欧等全球性事件意味着，中国央行管理人民币受到的关注和审视减少了。”
In spite of its improved communications and market-focused currency management, that is something the PBoC is likely to welcome.
尽管中国央行加强了沟通，并致力于市场化汇率管理，但它仍可能欢迎全球大格局的这种变化。
Billionaire investor George Soros had a lot to celebrate on Saturday evening: his 82nd birthday and the engagement to his much younger girlfriend, Tamiko Bolton.
亿万富翁、投资家乔治?索罗斯上周六庆祝82岁生日时，宣布将迎娶比自己年轻很多的女友多美子-博尔顿。
Soros and Bolton, who met in the spring of 2008, formally announced their engagement at a party at Soros' summer home in Southampton, New York, attended by a small group of friends and relatives, according to a person familiar with the investor.
索罗斯与博尔顿于2008年春天相识。据与索罗斯相熟人士的消息，二人近日在纽约南安普敦避暑寓所举行生日派对时，向出席的少数亲友公布了订婚喜讯。
Soros proposed to Bolton, 40, a few weeks ago during a weekend visit to the Hamptons, a beachside colony on Long Island frequented by New York's wealthy.
几周前，在某个周末的汉普顿之旅时，索罗斯向40岁的博尔顿求婚。纽约的富豪们经常到海边度假胜地长岛汉普顿游玩。
For Soros, this will be his third marriage and the second for Bolton, who was married briefly in the 1990s. Soros has five children from his previous marriages.
这是索罗斯的第三次婚姻，也是博尔顿的第二次婚姻。博尔顿在上世纪90年代有过一段短暂婚史。索罗斯之前有五名子女。
Last year, Adriana Ferreyr, a former girlfriend of Soros, filed a lawsuit alleging he had reneged on a promise to buy her an apartment. Soros has filed a pending motion to dismiss the suit by the former Brazilian soap opera star.
去年，索罗斯的前女友阿德里安娜?费雷拉控告索罗斯违反承诺，没有送她一套公寓。索罗斯正申请停止诉讼。费雷拉是巴西的一名肥皂剧女星。
Ferreyr's attorney, Robert Hantman, said: "I wish him the best of luck on his marriage, and now that he doesn't need the apartment, hopefully the case can be resolved."
费雷拉的律师罗伯特-亨特曼说：“我祝他婚姻幸福，现在看来他不需要这套公寓了，希望案子能尽快了结。”
Soros, who is an active contributor to politically liberal causes and frequently speaks on world economic events, converted his hedge fund into a family office in 2011 and stopped managing money for outside investors.
索罗斯积极支持政治自由主义，频繁发表有关全球经济事件的言论。他在2011年将旗下对冲基金转作家族基金，也不再为外部投资者进行资金管理。
Soros rose to fame and fortune two decades ago on a now-historic trade, in which he took on the Bank of England and shrewdly wagered on a devaluation of the British pound.
20年前，索罗斯向英格兰银行发起了挑战，精明地押注英镑贬值，攫取了巨额财富，也因此声名大振。这在现今来看也堪称历史上很著名的一次交易行为。
Bolton, who once started an Internet-based dietary supplement business and is now running a web-based yoga education business, has a master's degree in business from the University of Miami.
博尔顿拥有迈阿密大学商科硕士学位，曾在网上销售膳食补充剂，现在经营一家网络瑜伽培训机构。
The engagement ring Soros gave Bolton, according to a person close to him, is a Graff diamond in a platinum setting on a rose gold band.
据索罗斯身边的人传出消息，订婚戒指是一枚格拉夫钻戒，钻石镶在白金戒托上，戒圈为玫瑰金。
The case of an elderly woman found guilty of killing her disabled son has provoked an outpouring of compassion from Chinese social media users.
近日，一名老年妇女因杀死她的残疾儿子而获罪一案，引起了中国社交媒体上用户们的广泛同情。
The 83-year-old, identified only as Ms Huang, was found guilty of the manslaughter of her disabled son, Li.
这名83岁的黄姓老妇，因杀害她的残疾儿子黎某而获罪。
She fed her 46-year-old son about 60 sleeping pills on 9 May and strangled him with a silk scarf as she used cotton pads to cover his nose.
今年5月9日，她喂了她的46岁儿子约60颗安眠药，并且在用棉褥盖住他的鼻子时，用丝巾勒死了他。
Huang was found guilty of manslaughter by the People's Intermediate Court of Guangzhou and received a three-year suspended prison sentence.
黄某被广州市中级人民法院判处故意杀人罪，获有期徒刑3年。
She said she took her son's life because she feared no one would care for him after she died.
黄某称，她杀死自己的儿子，是因为她害怕在自己死后没有人照顾他。
Li was born prematurely with severe mental and physical disabilities that left him unable to walk or talk.
黎某因早产而患有严重的精神和身体残疾，这使得他无法走路或说话。
Prosecutors asked Huang why she could not have arranged for Li to have been cared for by his elder brother, but she said she was not prepared to burden him.
当检察官们询问黄某为何她没有安排黎某的哥哥来照顾他时，她表示自己不打算增加他的负担。
"It was my fault to give birth to him and make him suffer. I'd rather commit murder than leave him to someone else," Huang told the court.
黄某告诉法院：“把他生成这样，害他受苦，是我的错。我宁愿杀了他，也不要把他扔给别人。”
Judge Wan Yunfeng said: "She deserves mercy even though she did break the law."
法官万云峰表示：“虽然她违反了法律，但其悲可悯。”
The Oscars — Hollywood's biggest night — never needs introduction. People just watch it, or at least check out the winners list afterwards. The 84th Academy Awards, which ended last Sunday night, like any other previous ceremonies, has left us moments to remember — on stage and the red carpet. Let's take a look at what has wowed us at this year's Academy Awards.
作为好莱坞的盛大之夜，奥斯卡颁奖礼可谓地球人都知道的事。人们会守在电视旁观看，或至少事后会去查看一下获奖名单。同以往一样，于上周日晚落下帷幕的第84届奥斯卡无论是在舞台上还是红毯上，都给我们留下了许多难忘的记忆。下面就让我们一起回顾一下今年奥斯卡颁奖典礼上那些精彩时刻吧。
Octavia becomes tongue-tied
奥克塔维亚?斯宾瑟激动哽咽
The first emotional moment of the evening came with Octavia Spencer's supporting actress win for her role as a tart-tongued maid in The Help.
奥斯卡之夜的首个感人瞬间便是，女星奥克塔维亚?斯宾瑟凭借在电影《相助》中饰演讲话尖酸刻薄的女佣夺得了最佳女配角。
"Thank you Academy for putting me with the hottest guy in the room," she joked, referring to the golden Oscar statuette.
她指着奥斯卡小金人打趣说：“感谢奥斯卡让我和现场最性感的男士在一起。”
But then as she fought back tears and thanked her family, the tart-tongued became a little tongue-tied. "Please wrap up...I'm wrapping up. I'm sorry, I'm freaking out."
但随后，当她强忍住泪水感谢家人时，这位巧舌如簧的“女佣”开始哽咽起来。“拜托，请集中精神… …我正在总结。对不起，我快要被吓死了。”
Streep scoops her third Oscar
梅丽尔?斯特里普“梅开三度”
Meryl Streep, who holds the record with 17 for the most Academy Award nominations, won the Oscar for the best lead actress for her portrayal of former British Prime Minister Margret Thatcher in The Iron Lady. It's her third Oscar and the first since winning for Sophie's Choice in 1982.
梅丽尔?斯特里普保持着17次奥斯卡提名的纪录。凭借在《铁娘子》中对前英国首相撒切尔夫人一角的精彩诠释，梅姨荣登本届奥斯卡影后宝座。这是她的第三座奥斯卡小金人，也是继1982年因出演《苏菲的选择》夺得金像奖后首次捧得小金人。
Accepting her award, the 62-year-old, who couldn't hold back her tears, sounded less like a winning actress than a star who had just received a lifetime achievement award. "I look out there and I see my life before my eyes," Streep said in her speech.
62岁的斯特里普在领奖时，忍不住流下眼泪。她的获奖感言听起来不太像是一个获奖女星的致辞，倒更像是位刚获得终身成就奖的女星的感言。她在致辞时说：“我回首张望，看到了我的一生。”
Five Academy awards for silent tribute to Hollywood
向好莱坞致敬的默片横扫五项大奖
Hollywood sure showed some love for its history. The Artist, a French film that has been called a love letter to old Hollywood, charmed Oscar voters and scooped up five awards, including Best Actor, Best Director and Best Picture.
当然，好莱坞也表现出对于自身历史的情有独钟。被称作“给好莱坞黄金时代的情书”的法国影片《艺术家》，受到奥斯卡评委们的追捧，一举拿下了最佳男演员、最佳导演和最佳影片等五项大奖。
The film, which tells a romantic story of a fading star, has brought the Oscar the first French best actor, and it has also made a dog star, Uggie, who made an appearance onstage.
该片讲述了一位风光不再的影星的爱情故事。这部影片也诞生了奥斯卡史上首位法国影帝。剧中的狗狗Uggie也成为了大明星，并现身颁奖现场。
By the way, did we mention that The Artist is made in the style of old silent and black and white film?
顺便说一句，我们刚才好像没有提《艺术家》是一部老式黑白默片？
Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of News Corporation, and the former model Jerry Hall got engaged over the weekend and announced their pending nuptials Tuesday in the classifieds of a newspaper he owns.
新闻集团执行主席鲁伯特·默多克(Rupert Murdoch)，与曾为模特的杰瑞·霍尔(Jerry Hall)在上周末订婚，并于周二在默多克名下的报纸上宣布了他们即将结婚的消息。
The engagement announcement appeared in The Times of London on the Births, Marriages and Deaths page of the newspaper. They were engaged over the weekend in Los Angeles, a spokesman for Mr. Murdoch said, and they appeared together at the 73rd Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday.
订婚声明发表于《泰晤士报》的“出生、婚姻和死亡”版面。据默多克的发言人称，他们上周末在洛杉矶订婚。二人还一起出席了第七十三届金球奖颁奖典礼。
“They have loved these past months together, are thrilled to be getting married and excited about their future,” the spokesman, Steven Rubenstein, said in a statement by email.
默多克的发言人斯蒂芬·鲁宾斯坦在一封邮件中写道：“他们相爱数月，对结婚这一决定感到非常开心，也对他们的未来充满了期待。”
It will be the fourth marriage for Mr. Murdoch, 84, and the second for Ms. Hall, 59. Mr. Murdoch split with his third wife, Wendi Deng Murdoch, in 2013 after 14 years. He was previously married to Patricia Booker, an Australian, and later to Anna Torv, a journalist.
这将是84岁的默多克的第四段婚姻，也是59岁的霍尔的第二段婚姻。2013年，默多克结束了与第三任妻子邓文迪的婚姻。他的第一任妻子是澳大利亚人帕特里夏·布克，第二任妻子则是记者安娜·托芙。
Ms. Hall wed the singer Mick Jagger in a Hindu ceremony in Bali, but their marriage was annulled in 1999.
霍尔曾与歌手米克·贾格尔在巴厘岛的印度教仪式中成婚，但这段婚姻在1999年告终。
Mr. Murdoch, who is also co-executive chairman, with his son Lachlan, of 21st Century Fox, and Ms. Hall began dating last year after they were introduced by one of his sisters and a niece in Australia, according to The Times. They went public with their relationship in October.
根据《泰晤士报》，与其子拉克伦同为21世纪福克斯联合执行主席的默多克，去年在澳大利亚经由自己姐姐和侄女的介绍结识了霍尔，此后他们开始恋爱，并在十月公开了恋情。
Rupert Murdoch, the 84-year-old media mogul, will marry actress and former supermodel Jerry Hall, the couple announced in British newspaper The Times on Tuesday, after a four-month romance.
在经历了四个月的爱情长跑之后，现年84岁的传媒大亨鲁珀特·默多克将与曾经的超模杰丽·霍尔完婚，这对夫妇是上星期二在英国报纸《泰晤士报》上宣布这一消息的。
The couple got engaged over the weekend in Los Angeles, where they attended the 73rd Golden Globes awards gala.
这对夫妇出席了在洛杉矶举办的第七十三届金球奖颁奖晚会，并在那里订了婚。
Murdoch, the executive chairman of News Corporation, which owns The Times, announced the impending nuptials in the Births, Marriages and Deaths section of the newspaper.
默多克，这位新闻集团的董事会执行主席，是在该集团旗下的《泰晤士报》的生老病死、婚嫁宴舞这一栏目中公布了婚礼即将到来这一消息的。
"Mr Rupert Murdoch, father of Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan, James, Grace and Chloe Murdoch, and Miss Jerry Hall, mother of Elizabeth, James, Georgia and Gabriel Jagger, are delighted to announce their engagement," it read.
该文章这样写道：“鲁珀特·默多克先生，也是普鲁丹斯、伊丽莎白、劳赫兰、詹姆斯、格雷斯和克罗伊·默多克之父，与杰丽·霍尔小姐，也是伊丽莎白、詹姆斯、乔治娅和加布里奥·贾格尔之母，二人已经正式宣布订婚。”
The pair started dating late summer after being introduced by one of Murdoch's sisters and his niece, and first made their relationship public in October at the rugby World Cup final in London.
这对爱人是经由默多克的姐姐和侄女的介绍，自去年夏天开始交往的，并在10月份的伦敦橄榄球世界杯决赛上第一次公布恋情。
Between them they have 10 children from previous marriages, and went on holiday with several of them on a yacht in the Caribbean after Christmas.
他们两人在以前各自的婚姻中共育有10个孩子。在圣诞节后，两人还与其中的一些孩子在加勒比海的一艘游艇上共度假期。
This will be Murdoch's fourth marriage and the second for 59-year-old Hall.
这次将会是默多克的第四次婚姻，同时也是59岁的霍尔的第二次婚姻。
The director of the Chinese classic TV drama, Journey to the West, Yang Jie, passed away last Saturday. She was 88.
中国经典电视剧《西游记》的导演杨洁于上周六去世，享年88岁。
Under her guidance, the single camera typically used in that era managed to film an epoch-making TV drama that influenced generations of Chinese people.
在她的指导下，通过那个年代最通用的单摄像机，一部划时代的、影响了一代又一代中国人的电视剧得以摄制成功。
Journey to the West is a Chinese television series adapted from the classic novel of the same title.
《西游记》，这部中国电视连续剧改编自其同名的古典名著。
The drama is mainly an extended account of the legendary pilgrimage by the Tang Dynasty-era Buddhist monk Xuanzang and his three disciples, Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie and Sha Wujing.
该剧主要讲述的是唐朝和尚唐玄奘和他的三个徒弟：孙悟空、猪八戒、沙悟净的一场朝圣之旅。
They traveled to what then were called the "Western Regions", that is, Central Asia and India, to obtain Buddhist sacred texts and returned after many trials and much suffering.
师徒四人前往的目的地名为“西天”，位于现在的中亚和印度地区。师徒四人在历经千难万险之后，获得了真经并返回故土。
The series was first broadcast on CCTV in China on Oct 1, 1986.
1986年10月1日，这部连续剧在中国中央电视台首播。
The series became an instant classic in China and is still being praised as the best and most authentic interpretation of the novel.
《西游记》是中国电视连续剧的经典之作，至今仍被称为是对小说最好、最真实的翻拍之作。
Donald Trump has been endorsed by 88 former military leaders in an open letter, according to his campaign.
据唐纳德·特朗普的竞选阵营表示，88名美国军方前任高官在一封公开信中表示支持特朗普。
The group of retired generals and admirals declared the Republican nominee "has the temperament to be commander-in-chief".
这几十位退休将领宣称，共和党总统候选人特朗普“有成为总司令的气量”。
Mr Trump, who has highlighted veterans' issues during his campaign, called their support "a great honour".
特朗普在竞选活动中强调了退伍老兵的问题，声称得到他们的支持是“一个伟大的荣誉”。
The former top brass stated they believe Mr Trump is "more trusted to be commander-in-chief than (Democratic nominee) Hillary Clinton".
这些退休将领表示，他们相信特朗普“成为总司令要比（民主党候选人）希拉里·克林顿更值得信赖”。
"We believe that such a change can only be made by someone who has not been deeply involved with, and substantially responsible for, the hollowing out of our military and the burgeoning threats facing our country around the world," they added.
他们补充说道：“我们认为这种改变只能够由这样一个人来完成--他必须不那么深入体制，并且对不会挖空军队、在全世界面临迅速发展的威胁等问题上负责任。”
Despite making support for the military a signature issue in his campaign, Mr Trump has at various times drawn criticism from military members.
尽管特朗普阵营得到了军方的签字支持，但是特朗普曾经多次遭到军方人士的批评。
Most notably, he was involved in a recent spat with family members of a Muslim-American soldier killed during the Iraq War.
最值得一提的就是，特朗普最近陷入到了和一个牺牲在伊拉克战场上的穆斯林裔美国士兵的家庭的争论中。
Mr Trump, who has not served in the military, also created a stir last month when he accepted a veteran's gift of a Purple Heart.
特朗普没有在军队中服过役，但上个月，一名老兵将紫心勋章送给他当礼物，此事在当时引起了不小的轰动。
"I always wanted to get the Purple Heart," he said of the medal, which is awarded to soldiers wounded in war.
紫心勋章是授予那些在战争中受伤士兵的奖励，特朗普得到这枚勋章之后说道：“我一直想得到一枚紫心勋章。”
Bad news… you aren’t going to reach your goals. Why? Unfortunately, there are many reasons. We set goals all the time. But, often, we do not reach them。
坏消息：你没达成你的目标。为什么？不幸的是原因有很多。 我们总是在设定目标，但我们却常常没达成我们的目标。
There are many reasons that goals go unfulfilled. Maybe they were never clearly defined. Maybe the discipline was not there. For many, goal setting is a never ending circle that starts, stops, and beings again。
目标没有达成存在很多原因。也许是因为目标不够清晰明确，也许是因为没有做到自律。 对很多人来说，设定目标是一个无休止循环：开始，结束，然后又是开始，结束。
To help us succeed in reaching our goals, let’s examine the reasons why many people fail at reaching them. Here are 8 Reasons That You Won’t Reach Your Goals:
为了帮我们成功实现目标，我们来检查一下很多人没达成目标的原因。这里是8个你为什么没有达成目标的原因。
1. You Don’t Have Any Goals
你没有目标
Wayne Gretsky famously said, “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take。” The same can be said of goals. You will not attain 100% of the goals you don’t set. Too many people are afraid to “set” their goals. Afraid of failing. Afraid of disappointment. Afraid of what others might think. Well, you definitely won’t complete them if you don’t try. Make a choice and set your goals. Otherwise, you will will end up wherever life takes you。
加拿大冰球明星韦恩·格雷茨基有一句著名的话：“不开枪，你就百分百浪费了子弹。” 在设定目标方面也是同理。如果你不设定目标，你百分之百不会实现目标。很多人不敢设定目标。他们害怕失败，害怕失望，害怕他人的看大。然而，如果你都不去一试的话，你注定无法实现目标。做个选择，设定目标。否则，你只能任由生活主宰你。
2. You Don’t Start
你没开始
OK, so you have a goal. Maybe it’s to lose weight. Or to learn a new skill. To get a new hobby. What have you done about it? Have you started it yet? What are you waiting for? Procrastination is responsible for the demise of many goals。
你有一个目标。比如说是减肥，或是学一项新技能，或培养一个新爱好。 那你做过些什么？你开始行动过吗？你还在等什么？拖延让很多目标落空了。
3. You Aren’t Willing to “Buy” Your Goals
你不愿意“购买”你的目标
Yes. You have to buy your goals. Why? Because every goal has a price. It has a cost. Time. Money. Sweat. Sacrifice. You will have to “pay” for your goals in some manner. If you are not willing to make the investment, then you will not reach your goals. Determine what your goal is going to cost you, and whether or not you are willing to pay the price。
是的，你要购买你的目标！为什么？因为每一个目标都有一个价码。目标是要付出代价的：时间、金钱、汗水、奉献。你必须以某些方式为你的目标“付出”点什么。如果你不愿意做出投资，那么你是无法达成你的目标。确定一下你的目标需要你付出什么代价，再确认一下你是不是愿意付出这个代价。
4. Your Goals Are Unrealistic
你的目标不切实际
Setting goals is important, but ensuring that they are possible is important too. If you set your goals impossibly high, then you are not grounded in reality. Losing 30 lbs. in 30 days is not realistic. Becoming CEO of your company in a year, probably not going to happen. Make sure that your goals are possible and that you set an adequate time frame for success。
设定目标很重要，但保证目标可行同样重要。如果你设定的目标太高而不切实际，那么你无异于在建空中楼阁。在30天里减肥30磅不现实，一年内成为你所在公司的总裁也不太可能发生。确认自己的目标是否可行，同时确保为成功实现目标也预留了充足的时间。
5. You Won’t Stick With It
你没坚持
Over half of goals will be given up within 30 days. You set your goals. You started them. And then… you gave up. You didn’t have the discipline to stay the course. Are you using life’s daily happenings as excuses? I couldn’t go to the gym today because work was too busy. I could not work on my book because I was too tired. Goals are not reached through one momentous effort. Rather, they are made in small steps over time。
超过半数的人在30天内就放弃目标了。你设定了目标。你着手去做了。然后你放弃了。你没有做到自律让自己的目标继续下去。你在用日程琐事作为借口吗？今天我不能去健身了因为工作太忙了。我看不进书了因为我太累了。只求通过一次努力是无法达成目标的。它们是通过一步一步、一次次累积完成的。
6. They Are Not “Your” Goals
它们不是“你的”目标
Why did you pick the goals you set? Is it something that you wanted to accomplish, or is it something that others wanted you to do? Something that was expected of you? If your goals are not your own, you will not have the passion and drive to complete them. Too often, we put goals are on our plate that are not our own. In these cases, we are destined for failure. Ensure that your goals align with your own values and dreams。
为什么你会选择设定这样的目标？这是你想实现的吗？或者这些是他人想要你去做的事？是别人对你的期待？如果你的目标不是你自己的，你就没有激情和动力去实现它。太多时候我们追求的不是我们自己的目标。在这种情况下，我们注定要失败。确信你的目标符合你自身的价值观和梦想。
7. You Will Fail… and You Won’t Get Back Up!
你会失败……而且你一蹶不振
No one succeeds immediately. Overnight success is a myth. Those who appear to have effortlessly succeeded have usually put in years of preparation and practice. The secret is that when you fall down… you have to get back up. You have to fall down many times before you will succeed. Skill is learned by doing。
没有人能一步登天。一夜成名是一个神话。那些看似轻轻松松就成功的人，通常是投入了好几年时间去准备和练习。 秘诀在于：当你跌倒时，你得再站起来。在你成功前，你会跌倒很多次。技能是在实践中学来的。
8. You Quit Before the Finish Line
在最后关头你退却了
Too many people stop… right before the finish. It’s almost like they don’t want to get there. They are afraid of succeeding. Often a life event is used as the reason for not finishing. Something always comes up before you finish. You get sick. An emergency occurs. Unforeseen events happen. (Life always does…) Don’t let “life” be the reason your do not attain your goal。
很多人在到达终点前的最后一刻停下来了。看起来似乎是他们不想穿越终点线。他们害怕成功。通常一件生活小事会被用来作为不完成的理由。在你完成前总会有事发生：你生病了，突发事情来了，不可预见的事情发生了。(生活总是如此……)不要让“生活”成为你没达成目标的理由。
Are you reaching your goals? Which of these is keeping you from succeeding? Are you “paying the price” for your goals, or are you simply letting life take you where it goes? Set your goals. Stay the course. Always get back up when you fail. And make sure you cross the finish line。
你达成目标了吗？在这些原因中，哪些是阻碍你成功的原因？你为你的目标付出代价了吗？或者你仅仅是让生活主宰你？设定目标。保持进度。当你失败时，振作起来。最后确信你要穿越终点线。
Kate Hashimoto was picking up a few groceries at the Upper West Side Food Emporium when she ran into a friend。
这天凯特·桥本与她朋友相遇时，她正在上西街区的食品商场捡拾一些杂货品。
“Hey Kate, you like wraps? Here’s a chicken wrap,’’ her pal said. “But be careful, it’s kind of wet。” They weren’t in the grocery aisle. They were in front of the store, digging through three overflowing trash bins。
“嘿凯特，你喜欢肉卷吗？这有个鸡肉卷，” 她朋友说道。“但是小心，还有点湿。” 她们的对话并不是在什么杂货店的走廊里。她们站在商店前，在三个漫出来的垃圾箱翻找着。
Hashimoto Dumpster-dives for all her food, doesn’t use toilet paper or do laundry, and hasn’t bought toiletries in 10 years. She doesn’t have to live this way — she’s an employed CPA。
10年来桥本一直都在垃圾箱里找食物，不用厕纸，不去洗衣店，也没有买过任何化妆品。她其实并不需要这样生活，她是一名有工作的注册会计师。
“I’ve always been frugal, but it was when I was laid off in the dot-com crash that I became extreme,” Hashimoto explained。
“我一直都很节俭，但是如此极端的生活方式，却是在被一家网络公司解雇后才开始的。” 桥本这样解释道。
“No job is guaranteed, so I live as if I could be fired at any time。” Manhattan, she said, is a gold mine for Dumpster divers。
“没有哪个工作是铁饭碗，所以我以这样的方式过活，这样就算是被解雇了我也有所准备。” 她说对于以捡垃圾为生的人们，曼哈顿是一座金矿。
“Consumers in wealthy areas expect their products to be perfect, so upscale stores throw out a lot of items that are still good。
“生活在富裕地区的人们，往往希望他们的一切生活用品保持完美，所以那些高档的商店会把很多还很新的产品扔掉。”
“New York can be the most expensive place to live, but it can also be the least expensive if you know how to work the system。” Hashimoto let The Post spend a day with her learning how to live way below your means。
“纽约可能是生活费用最高的地方，但如果你知道怎么生活，所需要的费用可能是最便宜的。” 桥本邀请记者用一天的时间和她学学如何像她一样生活。
She lives in Harlem, where she bought a studio in 2010 and paid it off in nine months, but treks down to the Upper West Side three times a week for good, free food。
她住在纽约黑人居住集中的哈莱姆区。2010年她在那里买下了一个工作室，用了九个月就将贷款全部支付完毕。但是她每周会去三次上西区，捡一些免费的用品和食物。
Her other money-saving methods include using soap to wash herself after using the toilet, taking surveys online to earn gift cards, participating in medical trials (she got free birth control for 5 years and took part in a herpes vaccine trial for cash)， testing products for free samples, cutting her own hair, washing her clothes while she showers, and running to work to avoid using a MetroCard。
她还有许多其他省钱妙招，包括用肥皂不用厕纸，做一些网上的有奖调查赚些礼品卡，参与医疗实验(她免费获得可使用五年的避孕产品，参加一项疱疹疫苗试验还得到了现金奖励)，产品体验的免费样品，自己理发，边洗澡边洗衣服，还有跑步上班以省下地铁费用。
“I was extremely angry about the latest round of subway fare hikes,” she said。
“我听到地铁票涨价的消息时气疯了，”她说。
Hashimoto does have her limits. Her furniture is a collection of found freebies — but she won’t take an old mattress for fear of bedbugs, and sleeps instead on used yoga mats。
桥本也有她的底线。她的家居都是免费赠品，但是她情愿睡在旧的瑜伽毯上，也不用旧的床垫，害怕会有螨虫。
And she won’t stay in a relationship for free meals。
而且她也不会免费三餐而跟男人交往。
“I’ve been in a relationship where I stayed because I was getting freebies and gifts, but I got out of it,” she says. “It’s better to be single and Dumpster-diving than to be with someone you can’t stand。”
“我曾经为了得到免费赠品而谈了一个男朋友，但是我放弃了。” 她说。“我情愿单身，翻垃圾找食物，也不要和一个我无法忍受的人在一起。”

1. Pick a positive environment
1.挑选积极的环境
The most talented people in any industry are in demand and have options where they want to work. A high-trust environment fosters what some call psychological safety, resulting in a more open and collaborative work culture.
任何行业都需要最有天赋的人，他们能选择理想的工作地点。信任度高的工作环境能培养心理安全感，从而形成更开放合作的工作文化。
2. Demonstrate concern
2.表现出关心
Trust operates on multiple levels: at a company level in terms of culture, at a team level in regard to the relationships among the members, and at an interpersonal level between two people. By showing you care about your colleagues, others will begin to trust and a relationship of mutual trust can build.
信任有多个层面：就文化而言体现在公司层面，就员工关系而言体现在团队层面，两个人之间体现在人际关系层面。你关心同事，其他人就开始信任你，也就能建立起相互信任的关系。
3. Be self-revealing
3.自我表露
Within limits, sharing a bit about who you are can be extremely helpful. Especially for leaders or managers, sharing a story about a time you may have failed and what you learned from it can build camaraderie and trust.
在一定限度内让别人了解一点真实的你非常有好处。尤其对领导或管理者来说，分享一段你的失败经历和你学到的经验能帮你建立友谊和信任。
4. Strive for competency
4.尽量胜任
Employees should strive to be seen as competent in their role. This means having the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities in his or her area. Employees should focus on their competence, values, and benevolence in order to build trust.
员工应该争取胜任自己分内的工作。这意味着你要有该领域必要的知识、技能和能力。员工应该关注自己是否胜任、自身价值和善行，以便建立信任。
5. Manage expectations
5.控制好期望值
Set realistic expectations and trust in the competence of others. Strive for clarity regarding what you expect from others and what they expect from you.
你要设定符合实际的期待值，并且相信他人能做到。明确自己对他人的期待以及他人对你的期待。
6. Establish boundaries
6.明确界限
To clarify boundaries, clearly define roles and responsibilities and be sure that people understand what they are responsible for.
为了明确界限，你可以明确地定义角色和职责并确信人们明白自己的责任。
7. Set an example
7.树立榜样
This means listen and consider others’ ideas with an open mind and be respectful of all employees. The leader has to serve as a role model. He or she has to be seen as credible.
这意味着你要虚心地倾听并思考他人的想法并尊重所有员工。领导要以身作则，要可靠。
8. Understand the role of emailing
8.明白电子邮件的作用
Even if a colleague is working hard, his e-mail correspondent doesn’t know it. If you work virtually, show up in person for key meetings as much as possible because visual cues are key for trust.
即使一个同事工作努力，但和他靠电子邮件联系的人却不知情。如果你真的工作了，就尽可能多亲自出席重要会议，因为视觉接触是信任的关键。
There’s no age limit when it comes to being a millionaire these days, and a handful of kids have struck it rich well before they can legally vote. They’re small business owners, inventors and entrepreneurs. I started as an entrepreneur when I was around 11 years old with my first candy stand, which grew to four candy stands, but that was nothing compared to some of these kids!
如今，成为百万富翁不存在年龄的限制，许多青少年在获得投票权之前便已经创造了大笔财富。他们是小公司的老板、发明家和创业者。我也在大约11岁的时候开始创业——经营一个糖果摊，后来扩张到了四个！不过，与这些孩子们相比，我的经历根本不值一提！
There’s is no age limit, either, when it comes to learning from others. These impressive kids learned from their own failures early in life but determined to keep going and to do it better the next time around. If you haven’t made your first million yet, the teen next door might actually be able to teach you something.
同样，所谓学无先后，达者为师。这些孩子很早就从自己的失败中汲取教训，但依旧决定坚持下去，让自己在下一次做得更好。如果你还没有赚得第一桶金，或许隔壁邻居家的小朋友能够教你两手。
Check out these eight kids who made a million, or more, and what you can learn from their success:
下文介绍的八位小孩已经赚得百万身家，看看他们的创业之路能够带给你什么启迪。
1. Evan of EvanTube
1. EvanTube频道的埃文
With the help of his dad, this 8-year-old launched his own YouTube channel, titled EvanTube, and rakes in about $1.3 million each year. He reviews toys, talks about things that other kids his age are into, and he’s secured an audience that will grow with him. There are quite a few YouTube millionaires, so if you have the charisma to pull it off, it’s a free avenue for creating your own brand. Unfortunately, few entrepreneurs have the cuteness factor of Evan on their side.
在老爸的帮助下，年仅8岁的埃文推出了自己的YouTube频道——EvanTube，每年能够赚得大约130万美元的收入。他在这个频道评论玩具，谈论同龄小孩关注的话题，已经培养了一群将与他一起成长的小观众。YouTube上有许多百万富翁。所以，如果你也拥有足够吸引眼球的超凡魅力，这里可以提供一个免费的场所，让你创建自己的品牌。不幸的是，很少有创业者能像埃文那么萌。
2. Christian Owens
2. 克里斯蒂安o欧文斯
His motivator was Steve Jobs, and that’s how Owens made his first million at the age of 16. He got his own PC computer as an adolescent (soon followed by a Mac) and taught himself web design in middle school. By the age of 14, he’d started his own design company. Founder of Mac Bundle Box, he negotiated with developers and manufacturers to offer simple, discounted packages for his customers. The lesson? Follow your passions, claim your mentors and find a way to give people what they want for less.
受史蒂夫o乔布斯的启发，欧文斯在16岁时就赚到了他的第一个100万。他在少年时期就有了自己的PC机（很快又换成了一台Mac电脑），上中学时自学了网页设计。14岁时，他成立了自己的设计公司。作为Mac Bundle Box的创始人，他与开发者和制造商谈判，为客户提供简单的优惠套餐。要问他的经验是什么，那就是追随你的兴趣，结交良师益友，找出方法以更低的价格满足人们的需求。
3. Adam Hildreth
3. 亚当o海德里希
When he was just 14, Hildreth got together with friends to create Dubit—a social networking site. It was wildly popular in the UK and by his sixteenth birthday he had nearly $3.7 million in the bank. He then moved on to developing Crisp, which is a software company that helps protects kids from online predators. There’s nothing wrong with jumping on a trending bandwagon, but if you want continued success then find a way to branch out from it and innovate.
海德里希在14岁的时候便与朋友们一起创建了社交网站Dubit。这个网站在英国非常受欢迎，到16岁生日的时候，他的银行账户上已经有370万美元。他后来又创办了一家软件公司Crisp，旨在保护孩子们免受网络掠夺者的伤害。追随潮流没有错，但如果你希望继续成功，最好找到拓展业务的方式，并进行创新。
4. Cameron Johnson
4. 卡梅隆o约翰逊
Johnson was asked by his parents to develop invitation cards for a neighborhood party when he was 11. The guests adored the cards and started paying him to craft their own personal use cards. He founded “Cheers and Tears” by 14, then Cameron moved on to online advertising and software development. By high school, his monthly income was around $400,000. The lesson? Do everything well and don’t be afraid to try new things (or industries).
在约翰逊11岁的时候，他的父母要求他为一次邻居派对设计邀请卡。客人们都很喜欢他的邀请卡，并开始付钱请他设计卡片。他在14岁时成立了“Cheers and Tears”，后来又投身在线广告业和软件开发。他在高中时的月收入已经达到40万美元。他带给我们的经验就是：把每一件事都做好，不要害怕尝试新事物（或新行业）。
5. Geoff, Dave, and Catherine Cook
5. 杰夫、戴维和凯瑟琳o库克
These dynamic siblings are behind, “MyYearbook,” a (still) popular social media site that’s based on where you went to school. These kids had just moved to a new school and wanted to make new friends, so an online yearbook seemed like the perfect place to start. This was before Facebook was a household name. The lesson? Sometimes nepotism works, and if you find a disparity in the market, you can be the one to fill it.
这三位充满活力的兄妹，就是目前仍然极具人气的社交媒体网站“MyYearbook”的创办者，该网站立足于美国的校园。兄妹三人当时刚刚来到新的学校，希望认识新朋友，而在线年鉴似乎是寻找新朋友最合适的地方。当时，Facebook尚未变成家喻户晓的品牌。他们带给我们的经验就是：裙带关系有时候是有效的，只要你能找到市场中的差异，你就有望成为那个填补这个缝隙，并从中获利的人。
6. Farrhad Acidwalla
6. 法勒哈德o埃希德瓦拉
In between attending school in Mumbai, India, this 16-year-old is the founder of Rockstah Media. It’s a comprehensive marketing agency boasting 20 employees around the world. “My team is the backbone of my company,” says Acidwalla. The lesson? Everyone has the same hours in the day, so if even those with limitations (like being a kid) can grow a company like this, so can you.
16岁的埃希德瓦拉是印度孟买的一名学生，同时也是Rockstah Media的创始人。该公司是一家综合性市场营销机构，在全世界约有20名员工。埃希德瓦拉说道：“我的团队便是公司的骨干。”经验？每个人每天都拥有同样多的时间，既然受到各种限制的人（比如孩子）可以经营好一家公司，你肯定也可以。
7. Emil Motycka
7. 埃米尔o摩迪卡
What started as a lawn mowing business when he was nine turned into Motycka Enterprises by the time he was 18. In order to keep up with all the demands of a teenager, he works the graveyard shift and says, “I sleep four hours a night on average” and call it sleep for the week. That amount of sleep might not be the best advice, but perseverance, and being willing to do what it takes to get the work done, can certainly get you to his level.
埃米尔o摩迪卡在9岁时成立了一家草坪修剪公司，等到他18岁的时候，这家公司变成了Motycka Enterprises。为了跟上对一位青少年的所有要求，他经常会熬夜工作。摩迪卡说：“我平均每晚睡四个小时”。当然，如此少的睡眠或许并不值得鼓励，但坚持不懈的毅力，以及为了完成工作不惜付出一切的决心，肯定能帮你达到他的高度。
8. Ryan of “Ryan’s Barkery”
8. 卖狗粮的莱恩
One of the handful of kids featured on “Shark Tank,” as an elementary school kid, Ryan raked in $25,000 for 25 percent of his business. Now Ryan is 12 years old, and is the young entrepreneur and founder of a dog treat bakery. He is building his business in an industry (pet pampering) that’s recession-proof. The lesson? Find your own niche, it’s there waiting for you.
参加过《创智赢家》的孩子屈指可数，莱恩便是其中之一。上小学时，他出售了自己公司25%的股份，赚了25,000美元。现年12岁的莱恩是一位年轻的创业者，也是一个狗粮品牌Barkery的创始人。他所处的是一个能够抵御经济衰退的行业（宠物用品）。他的经验？寻找你自己的细分市场。它就在那里，正等着你去发现。
Think you’re beyond the age limit to make a million? Think again. Experience and maturity come with their own benefits.
读到这里，你是否觉得自己已经过了成为百万富翁的年纪？不妨再想想。经验和成熟自有其优势。（财富中文网）

Eight Chinese tourists are embroiled in a dispute after they were handed a bill for 16,500 shekels (3,280 pound) at a restaurant in the Israeli Arab village of Abu Ghosh.
近日，在位于以色列一个名为阿布·高什的阿拉伯村庄的一家餐馆，8名中国游客共消费了1.65万新锡克尔(折合3280英镑)，随后这件事在网上引发了热议。
The high cost of the meal at the restaurant, also named Abu Ghosh, came to light after an Israeli tour operators association posted a copy of the bill on the internet, showing that the eight diners had been charged pound 800 for a private room, pound 130 for starters, pound 1180 for alcohol, pound 628 for main courses and pound 270 for dessert. They were also charged pound 300 for service.
这家提供高昂饭费的餐馆名字也叫阿布·高什，在以色列一旅行协会在网上晒出了这张帐单后，这顿天价饭才得以曝光。该帐单显示，8人订包间价格800英镑，开胃菜价格130英镑，酒水价格1180英镑，主菜价格628英镑，甜点价格270英镑，另外还收取了300英镑服务费。
The village of Abu Ghosh, in the hills near Jerusalem, is popular with tourists for the rustic local restaurants, many of which specialise in hummus.
阿布·高什村庄位于耶路撒冷附近的山中，当地有多家物美价廉的小餐馆，很受游客欢迎，特色食品是一种叫做"胡姆斯"的美食。
According to Israeli business magazine Globes, the tour operator said: "A group of eight Chinese on a tour of Abu Ghosh stopped to eat at the Abu Ghosh Restaurant. There may be a billion Chinese, but they may not all be suckers. These Chinese said they would not be back and would not recommend their friends to visit Israel.
据以色列商业杂志《环球报》报道，这家旅行社声称："8名到阿布·高什来游玩的的中国人在阿布·高什餐馆吃饭。中国人有十亿多，但他们可不都是傻瓜。这些中国游客表示，他们不会再到以色列来了，也不会再推荐他们的朋友参观以色列。"
"Naive customers are a very shaky basis for a business plan, and by behaving this way we are destroying with our own hands the budding potential of the Chinese market for Israel."
"利用顾客的无知来达成商业目的是不可靠的，这家餐馆的做法是在亲手摧毁刚刚向以色列开放的中国游客市场"。
However, one of the restaurant's owners, Jawdat Ibrahim, said the bill was justified and was a "realistic cost" for the meal.
然而，餐馆的所有者之一乔达特·易卜拉欣却表示，这张帐单是公正的，这顿饭确实值这么多钱。
He said: "I received a telephone call that a group of Chinese tourists wanted to come to the restaurant, on condition that we close the restaurant to all other diners.
他说："我接到一个电话说有一个中国旅游团要来这儿，条件是我们不接待其他的客人。"
"We are talking about a Friday, and Friday and Saturday are the busiest days of the week for us. We have room for 300 people, and we closed it all for this group, which had the whole place to itself."
"我们就定到了一个星期五。星期五和星期六通常是我们一周中生意最好的时候。我们的餐馆可以容纳300人，但我们只接待了中国的8人团，他们包下了整个餐馆。"
"They sat there from 3 pm on Friday until midnight, and became rowdy and drunk. They asked me to buy alcoholic drinks that I paid thousands of shekels for.
"他们从星期五下午3点一直呆到了凌晨，非常吵闹，还喝醉了。他们让我帮忙去买酒，我花了几千新锡克尔。
They asked that the bar should be kept available, they asked for 30 kg of stuffed mutton and other dishes. It wasn't a case of eating and leaving, and they even took all their leftovers with them afterwards."
他们要求我一直开着酒吧，还点了30公斤的酿羊肉以及其他的菜。他们不仅仅是吃饱了就走，离开时还打包带走了所有的东西。"
He added: "The truth is that I thought that they should pay much more, since I had no other diners that day.
他补充说道："事实上我认为，他们应该付的更多。因为那天我没有接待其他的客人。
They enjoyed themselves and thanked me, and now, two weeks later, they're trying to besmirch us.
他们玩得非常开心还感谢了我。现在，才过去了两周，他们就来诽谤我们。
If you analyze the total, you will realize that it is not a lot for what they received."
如果你分析下所有的东西，你就会发现，对于他们所享受的服务，这个帐单真的不算高。"
But his version of events is disputed by the Israeli tour company.
不过，据以色列旅行社称，老板的说法并不属实。
Israel Incoming Tour Operators Association chief executive Yossi Fattal told Globes the group arrived at the restaurant after 7pm and that the restaurant had not been closed especially for them.
以色列旅行社协会负责人约西·法塔接受《环球报》采访时表示，中国的8名游客是在晚上7点以后才去的，而且餐馆并非只接待他们。
In addition, he claims the alcohol was not specially ordered and had been placed on the table before the group arrived, and also that they had not been served 30kg of meat.
此外，他声称酒水并非特别去购买的，而是在他们到达餐馆时就已经在餐桌上了，而且他们也没有点30公斤的羊肉。
Your day goes by in a flurry of activity. But despite your busy day, it feels like you aren’t making any progress.
你整天被无数活动缠身。可是即便忙得团团转，你还是觉得自己的工作没任何进展。
You finish your day and it seems like you are further behind that when you started. You have to wonder, “Are you getting anything done?”
一天结束时，你甚至觉得工作进展还早得很。你不禁扪心自问：“我到底有没有做完什么事情？”
You work hard and go from one meeting to the next, one urgent matter to another. However, in the never-ending sea of tasks, you feel like you aren’t keeping up.
你拼命工作，一场赶一场地开会，忙不迭地处理紧急事宜。可是面对永无止境的各种任务，你竟觉得自己毫无进展。
Why are you working so hard, and not getting your work done? The main reason that most people don’t get their work done is that they are working on everything else.
为何你如此拼命，事情却总还是做不完？很多人事情做不完，是因为他们心思总是在别处。
When you finish your day, do you look at your to do list and think, “Why didn’t I get to the important stuff done today?”
一天结束时，你有没有翻翻任务清单问自己：“为什么今天又没把重要的事情做完？”
Here are 8 Reasons that You Aren’t Getting Things Done:
下面就是你事情总是做不完的8个原因：
1. Your Time Management Is Not Habit
1、没有养成时间管理的习惯
Time management is not something that you turn on and off like a light switch. You don’t use it only when you are up against a crisis. It has to be a built into your lifestyle and habits.
时间管理不像开关，任你开任你关。你只在火烧眉毛时才管理时间。其实，时间管理应该成为你生活方式和习惯的一部分才行。
2. Doing Other People’s Work
2、多管闲事
If you are doing other people’s work, when are you going to do your own? If you are always putting out other people’s fire drills, you aren’t’ going to get your work done.
如果你总是管别人的闲事，什么时候才能空下来面对自己的事情呢？如果你总是解救别人的燃眉之急，自然无法顾忌到自己的工作了。
3. You Are Disorganized
3、杂乱无序
By disorganized, I mean your workspace is a mess. It is hard to do that task if you can’t find it. Clean your desk and workspace so that you have room to work and know where your work is.
说你杂乱无序，首先指的是你的办公室一团糟。不改掉这个毛病，你很难处理好任务。只有整理好办公桌和办公室你才能宽敞办公、对工作一目了然。
4. You Don’t Have Deadlines
4、未设定最后期限
Tasks usually get done… right before they need to be done. Tasks without deadlines aren’t urgent and don’t have to be done. If your tasks don’t have a deadline then you will justify not doing them… yet.
任务总是在最需要完成的时候完成。无期限的任务不必着急，甚至不必去完成。如果你没给任务设定期限，很可能连碰都不碰吧。
5. Doing Everything But Your Work
5、心有旁骛
Are you checking your email, reading the news, updating Facebook, talking to coworkers, surfing the web, and checking your email again? You will never get to your work if you are doing everything else. Cut out the miscellaneous distractions, interruptions, etc. Close the email, turn off the internet if you must, and shut the door. Put your work in front of you and concentrate on that.
你又在查看邮件、浏览新闻、更新Facebook、与同事聊天、上网并再一次查看邮件了吧？如果你总是做其他琐事，工作怎么可能完成呢？撇开所有杂七杂八的琐事和干扰，关掉邮箱，必要的话就断开网络并关上门吧。工作就摆在眼前专心做吧。
6. Not Making Time For Your Work
6、没去挤时间
Many people say, “I never have time for my work.” You have to make time for it. Reserve time if you must. Try making appointments with your work. Put them on your calendar so other things do not take their place.
很多人说：“我总是没时间做自己的事情。” 那就挤时间呗。必要的话还可以预留好时间。为自己的事情定好计划，比如把任务写到日历上，决不让其他事情干扰。
7. Putting Things Off
7、一味拖延
Procrastination is the enemy of success. When you find yourself about to put off a task, ask yourself, “Could I do this now?” Are you putting it off simply because you don’t want to do it. Instead, "Just Do It Now."
拖延症是成功的敌人。当你感到自己开始拖延时，就问问自己：“这事儿现在做得了吗？” 要是你只是因为自己不想做而拖延任务，那“此刻就行动吧”。
8. You Don’t Finish Things
8、虎头蛇尾
During your day, you probably start many things… but do you finish them? 57 Things started and nothing finished is a recipe for a never-ending
或许你已经开始着手很多事情……但是，你都完成了吗？开了57件事情的头，却没有一件是完成的，任务清单越拉越长。事情一件一件做，做完了再做下一件。有一些完成的事情好过无数虎头蛇尾的任务。
Felice Cohen has squeezed her life into a 90 square ft flat.Ms Cohen, in her 40, pays just $700 a month to live in New York's Upper West Side - whilst neighbours are charged $3,000.
来看看菲利斯?科恩在纽约 Upper West Side的小公寓，租金高达700美元，仅只有8平米左右大小，而邻近的房子每月要付3000美元。

Ms Cohen, who happens to be a professional organiser, said the last three years in the apartment have been a joy and that friends even prefer to come and visit her.
科恩是名专业的发起人，她说在此生活了3年感到很愉快，朋友们都喜欢来看她。

She said: 'I'm sure there are some compromises, but it's worth it.'
她说:"我知道这是在大城市里生活的一种妥协，但这是值得的。"

'
The first night I slept in the apartment I had a panic attack,' she said.'When I went up to bed and I woke up in the middle of the night - I had a friend stay over because I thought I was going to fall out of the bed - when I woke up there was the ceiling and the wall on every side.
“我在这儿度过的第一个晚上，有种恐慌的疼痛”，她说“我爬上床半夜时就醒了——我让朋友陪我过夜，因为我怕从床上掉下去——当我醒来时，发现一切都无事。"

Smartphone application providers will be required to have real-name registration for users and to establish a system to review content starting Aug 1, according to a regulation released by the Cyberspace Administration of China last Tuesday.
国家互联网信息办公室上周二发布的规定要求，自8月1日起，手机应用程序(app)提供者须实施用户实名注册并建立内容审核机制。
The move aims to ensure the safety of information, the administration said. The regulation said mobile application providers should verify the identities of users by requiring mobile phone numbers or other information, though users can identify themselves with nicknames.
网信办表示，此举旨在确保信息安全。根据该规定，移动app提供者应当对用户进行基于移动电话号码或其他信息的身份认证，但用户在前台可使用昵称。
The administration said that while apps offer convenience, they are also used for spreading violence, terrorism, rumors and pornography, as well as for fraud.
该管理部门表示，虽然应用程序带来了便捷，但是也被用于传播暴力，恐怖主义，谣言和色情，以及欺诈行为。
"That is why it is urgent to regulate the app market to protect users' interests," an unnamed official with the administration was quoted as saying in a statement.
援引自一位不愿透露姓名的该部门官员在一份声明中所说的：“这就是为什么迫切需要规范应用程序市场，以保护用户的利益。”
More than 4 million apps are available on domestic app stores.
目前在国内应用商店上架的app超过400万款。
China had 688 million netizens as of the end of 2015, of whom 620 million surfed the internet with mobile phones, according to the latest report from the China Internet Network Information Center.
据中国互联网络信息中心的最新报告显示，截至2015年底，中国共计有6亿8800万网民，其中6亿2000万人会用手机上网。
Wang Sixin, a law professor at Communication University of China, said the regulation conforms to the nation's internet policy by balancing development and governance.
中国传媒大学法学教授王四新表示，通过平衡发展和治理，该法规符合国家的互联网政策。
"In the past, problems were solved case by case, because we had no app rules," he said. "But from Aug 1, when the regulation takes effect, app providers will have more responsibility to verify users' registration and information."
他说：“在过去，问题需要一个一个解决，因为我们没有应用程序的相关规定。但是从8月1日起，当规范生效时，应用程序提供商将有更多的责任来验证用户的注册和信息。”
Fang Xindong, founder of Chinalabs, said it is not difficult for app providers to have real-name registration, "as the mobile phone number gives your real identity."
互联网实验室的创始人方兴东表示，应用程序提供商实施实名注册并不困难，因为手机号码就提供了你的真实身份信息。
App providers are asked not to use personal information without users' consent, and anyone releasing illicit information should be warned, or have their service suspended or shut down under the regulation.
规定要求，未经用户同意，app提供者不得使用用户个人信息，对发布违法违规信息的，须采取警示、限制功能或关闭账号的措施。
Consumer prices in China rose at their fastest pace in 13 months but factory gate prices continue to emphasise slack and overcapacity in the world's second largest economy.
8月份，中国消费价格上涨速度是13个月以来最快的，但工业品出厂价格(PPI)却继续凸显出世界第二大经济体的疲软与产能过剩。
China's consumer price index ticked up from 1.6 per cent in July to 2 per cent in August, higher than forecasts. That's the fastest rate since July 2014 but it remains well below Beijing's target of "around 3 per cent" this year.
8月份，中国全国居民消费价格总水平(CPI)的同比涨幅从7月份的1.7%升至2.0%，高于预期。这是自2014年7月以来的最大涨幅，但仍远低于中国政府为今年定下的“3%左右”的目标。
Meanwhile, producer prices not only deflated for a 42nd consecutive month, but the trend worsened to -5.9 per cent, its deepest since 2009.
另一方面，PPI不但连续第42个月下降，而且降幅还越来越大，8月份同比下降5.9%，为2009年以来的最大降幅。
"Consumer price inflation in China has been bolstered by food inflation in recent months," said Moody's Analytics before the release.
“近几个月来，中国的CPI受到了食品价格上涨的支撑，”穆迪分析(Moody's Analytics)在上述数据公布前表示。
Outside that, inflation pressures are minimal as a result of low energy prices, the still-recovering housing market, and the overcapacity across many sectors of the economy.
除此之外，通胀压力非常小，这是因为能源价格低、住房市场仍在恢复中、以及许多行业产能过剩。
The sustained decline in producer prices reflects the downturn in China's housing market, which had led to excess supply of the materials used in the housing boom.
PPI持续下滑反映出中国住房市场的低迷，这种低迷导致住房市场繁荣时期所用到的材料供应过剩。
"Producer prices remain in deflation in China, because of the high supply of raw materials and commodities and the overcapacity within much heavy industry," Moody's said. " Demand remains weak and is not likely to pick up until the housing market recovers. Meanwhile stock market ructions may have caused businesses to slow spending further in July."
“中国的工业品价格仍在下滑，这是因为原材料和大宗商品供应量大，而许多重工行业又产能过剩。”穆迪表示，“需求仍然疲弱，而且在住房市场恢复前不太可能会回升。同时，股市动荡或许导致企业在7月份进一步减少了支出。”
China's headline consumer price inflation index rose 2 per cent in August from a year earlier. That was below the 2.3 per cent price increases recorded in July and less than the 2.2 per cent economists had forecast.
8月份，备受关注的中国消费者价格通胀指数同比上涨了2%，低于7月份录得的2.3%，也比经济学家预测的2.2%低。
This headline CPI is still much lower than the official target of 3.5 per cent, however, indicating the government will maintain its relatively loose monetary policy stance.
不过，这一备受关注的居民消费价格指数(CPI)的涨幅仍大大低于中国官方3.5%的通胀目标。这表明中国政府将维持相对宽松的货币政策立场。
However factory gate prices fell 1.2 per cent in August from a year earlier. That was more than the 0.9 per cent price fall recorded in July and more than the 1.1 per cent fall economists had forecast.
而8月份工业品出厂价格同比却下跌了1.2%，跌幅大于7月份的0.9%，也大于经济学家预计的1.1%。
It was the 30th consecutive month producer prices had declined.
这是中国工业品出厂价格指数连续第30个月下滑。
Factory gate prices in China fell the least since 2012 last month, signalling continued improvement in conditions for the country’s manufacturers as consumer prices rose less than expected.
上月，中国工业品出厂价格(PPI)出现自2012年以来的最低降幅，显示出中国制造业的状况继续好转，居民消费价格(CPI)涨幅则低于预期。
The official producer price index saw its softest fall since April 2012, contracting only 0.8 per cent year on year and performing markedly better than the drop of 1.8 per cent seen in July, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
中国国家统计局数据显示，PPI同比仅下降0.8%，降幅为2012年4月以来最小，比7月份1.8%的降幅更是好得多。
The figure was largely in line with a median forecast of -0.9 per cent.
这一降幅与经济学家预期的降幅中值0.9%基本相符。
In month-on-month terms producer prices rose 0.2 per cent for the second month running.
环比来看，PPI上涨了0.2%，与7月份的涨幅相同。
The annualised contractions in the extraction and raw materials categories were the sharpest at levels of -3.2 per cent and -2.3 per cent, respectively.
采掘和原材料工业的价格同比降幅最大，分别为3.2%和2.3%。
But a headline figure for producer prices of daily necessities showed no change, neither rising nor falling as prices for food, clothing and daily necessities all saw expansion.
不过，生活资料总体价格没有变化、既未上涨也未下跌，其中，食品、衣着和一般日用品价格都有上涨。
In an explanatory note released alongside the new figures the statistics bureau noted a pronounced base effect from the previous year had helped drive producer prices falls to moderate in July and August.
在与新数据一同发布的解读中，中国国家统计局指出，7、8月份受去年基数较低影响收窄幅度较大。
Meanwhile the official consumer price index rose 1.3 per cent last month, down from 1.8 per cent in July. That was also 0.4 percentage points below a median forecast from economists.
上月的CPI同比上涨1.3%，涨幅低于7月份的1.8%，比经济学家的预期中值也低了0.4个百分点。
Pork prices rose 6.4 per cent year on year last month, adding 0.18 percentage points to the overall rise, or less than half their contribution in July.
上月猪肉价格同比上涨6.4%，为CPI总体上涨贡献0.18个百分点，不到7月份贡献值的一半。
Vegetable prices were down 3.9 per cent for the period, pushing down the headline figure by 0.9 percentage points.
鲜菜价格下跌3.9%，把CPI拉低了0.9个百分点。
That brought food inflation to 1.5 per cent, while prices in transport and communication were down 1.2 per cent year on year thanks to low core inflation (which strips out energy and food prices) of around 1.6 per cent.
受此影响，食品烟酒价格同比上涨1.5%。剔除能源和食品价格的核心通胀率较低，为1.6%；交通和通信价格同比下跌1.2%。
In month-on-month terms, meanwhile, consumer prices rose only 0.1 per cent, falling 0.5 percentage points from July.
环比来看，8月份CPI只上涨了0.1%，涨幅比7月份低了0.5个百分点。
The bureau noted vegetable prices were up 7.9 per cent at the end of August, but pork prices were down 1.2 per cent for the period.
鲜菜价格环比上涨7.9%，猪肉价格环比下跌1.2%。
In non-food goods, a drop in domestic oil prices helped push down expenses, though the cost of rent nationwide grew for the seventh month straight.
在非食品类的商品方面，国内油价的下滑帮助压低了开支，尽管全国房租价格连续第7个月上涨。

China's manufacturing sector contracted slightly in August, underscoring the broader economic slowdown in Asia's largest economy.
8月份中国制造业活动略有收缩，凸显出这个亚洲最大经济体的宏观经济正在放缓。
The official manufacturing PMI was 49.7, exactly in line with expectations. It had been 50 the previous month - on the threshold that separates expansion from contraction.
8月份，中国官方的制造业采购经理人指数(PMI)为49.7，与预期完全一致。上个月，该指数的读数为50，正好落在荣枯线上。
Readings have been either a nudge north or south 50 in 2015.
2015年，该指数的读数一直是要么略高于50，要么略低于50。
The official PMI for the services sector was 53.4, versus a reading of 53.9 in July. (No estimates were given).
官方的服务业PMI则为53.4，略低于7月份的53.9。
Beijing's sizzling apartment-rental market cooled in August following three consecutive months of rises in both transactions and prices, the Beijing Morning Post reported last Thursday.
《北京晨报》上周四报道，在经过连续三个月的交易量和价格上升过后，八月份北京白热化的租房市场有所降温。
Transactions related to rental apartments decreased by 6.8 percent in August over July, while the average rent was on par with that of July, at 4,762 yuan ($713) per unit, according to the market research institute of Chinese real estate service B.A.5I5J Group.
据中国房地产服务集团我爱我家的市场调查显示，虽然八月的租金和七月不相上下，都是每套公寓均价为4762元，但是相比七月，八月份的租房交易量下降6.8%。
One-bedroom apartments were the most popular, accounting for 30.8 percent of all transactions last month, an increase of 0.5 percentage points over July, while the average rent for them was 4,285 yuan per unit, up 2.1 percent month-on-month.
一居室最受追捧，占上月总交易量30.8%，这一数字同比七月上涨0.5%，交易平均租金为每套4285元，每月上涨2.1%。
In contrast, apartments with two, three or more bedrooms all saw a slight drop in rent from their July levels.
与此相反，两室、三室甚至更多房间的租金相比七月水平有了轻微下降。
In other first-tier cities including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, one-bedroom apartments were also the most favored by tenants, showed a rental market report for the first half of 2016 released by 58.com, the leading classified service in China.
中国领先的分类服务门户58同城公布的2016年上半年租房市场报告显示，在包括上海、广州和深圳的其它一线城市，一居室也最受租客追捧。
Hu Jinghui, the vice president of B.A.&5I5J Group, said the apartment-rental market usually sees booming business in the period shortly after Chinese New Year and the summer graduation season, while in between the peak seasons the market is generally slack.
我爱我家集团副总裁胡景晖表示，春节过后不久和夏季毕业季期间，租房市场通常会欣欣向荣，然而在两个高峰季期间，市场通常会比较疲软。
"With the ease of the discrepancy between supply and demand, rental rates lack the momentum for a further rise," Hu said. "As for the Beijing market, rates may gradually fall in the fourth quarter."
胡景晖说道：“随着需求差的减少，租房率缺乏进一步上升的动力。至于北京市场的租房率，有可能在第四季度逐渐下降。”
A closely watched set of privately-produced PMI readings for China produced a bleak picture of the economy in August, with the overall 'composite' PMI reading indicating the economy was contracting, not expanding.
一组受到密切关注的、由民间机构调查得出的采购经理人指数(PMI)，描绘出了中国经济在8月份的惨淡景象，其中的“综合”PMI读数显示出，中国经济活动在收缩、而不是在扩张。
The Caixin-sponsored final manufacturing PMI reading for August was revised slightly upwards to 47.3, from a preliminary reading of 47.1. It was last above 50 - the threshold separating contraction from expansion - in February.
8月份的财新(Caixin)制造业PMI终值为47.3，略高于47.1的初值。该读数上次高于50（即区分活动收缩与扩张的荣枯线）还是在今年2月。
The weak manufacturing reading dragged the overall composite PMI for the economy as a whole to 48.8, versus 50.2 in July. The last time the overall PMI measure for this series showed contraction was in April 2014.
疲软的制造业读数，将衡量中国整体经济活动的综合PMI拉低至48.8，7月份则为50.2。综合PMI上次低于50，还是在2014年4月。
The services PMI for August was 51.5, slightly down from the 53.8 recorded in July, and was the lowest reading in 13 months.
8月份的财新服务业PMI为51.5，略低于7月份的53.8，是13个月来的最低值。
The Caixin-sponsored series is based on a much smaller sample of smaller, private companies and tends to be more volatile than the official reading. The official survey focuses on larger state enterprises.
这组由财新赞助的指数，调查样本相对小得多，调查对象也是民营中小企业，读数往往比官方PMI读数的波动性更大。中国官方的PMI调查，聚焦于规模较大的国有企业。
Human decisions to sell stocks may have been behind the August rout for equity markets after all, with hedge fund and mutual fund managers selling in response to turbulence and fears for China’s economy.
8月份全球股市下跌可能还是人为做出的抛售决定所致。面对市场动荡和围绕中国经济的担忧，对冲基金和共同基金经理纷纷抛出股票。
The conclusion, based on work by strategists at JPMorgan, is a riposte to those who have attempted to blame esoteric trading strategies such as “risk parity” for the correction’s size and speed.
这个结论是根据摩根大通(JPMorgan)策略师的研究得出的，它是对另一派观点的还击，后者企图将股市调整的规模和速度归咎于深奥难懂的交易策略，如“风险平价”。
“Discretionary managers were likely the ones responsible for the recent equity market sell-off,” Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, global asset allocation strategist for the bank, told clients.
“全权委托经理人很可能要对近期股市抛售负责，”摩根大通全球资产配置策略师尼可拉斯堠尼吉左格鲁(Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou)告诉客户。
Macro hedge funds and balanced mutual funds, both of which can invest in a variety of asset classes, took abrupt steps to reduce the risk of stock losses during the month. The aggregate equity beta of portfolios, a measure of the relationship between equity index movements and those for individual investment funds, declined sharply in August.
宏观对冲基金和平衡型共同基金（两者均可投资于各种资产类别）在8月期间采取紧急行动降低股票亏损风险。各投资组合的整体股票贝塔系数（衡量股指变动与个别投资基金变动之间的关系）在8月份急剧下降。
The bank also found betas for so-called long-short hedge funds declined sharply in August as managers reacted to volatility by paring bets. JPMorgan’s work is based on a regression analysis of index movements, such as the HFRX, a hedge fund benchmark, as a proxy for fund holdings.
摩根大通还发现，所谓的多空对冲基金的贝塔系数也在8月份大幅下降，原因是经理人纷纷通过平仓对波动性作出反应。该行的研究是基于对指数变动（如对冲基金基准指数HFRX）的回归分析，将指数作为基金持股的代表。
The beta for risk parity funds, by comparison, declined only a small amount. Such funds have attracted attention owing to attempts to blend stocks, bonds and commodities, with selective use of leverage to produce returns similar to traditional investment products, while taking less risk.
相比之下，风险平价基金的贝塔系数仅小幅下降。近年此类基金受到关注，因为它们试图混合持有股票、债券和大宗商品，然后选择性地使用杠杆，在降低风险的同时带来与传统投资产品相仿的回报。
Leon Cooperman, the founder of Omega Advisors, last week blamed “systemic/technical investors” for the August sell-off. The veteran investor pointed to influential risk parity strategies pioneered by hedge funds such as Bridgewater, as well as so-called CTAs, funds specialising in trading derivatives based on computer models.
欧米茄顾问公司(Omega Advisors)创始人利昂錠珀曼 (Leon Cooperman)上周将8月的抛售归咎于“系统性/技术型投资者”。这位经验丰富的投资者把矛头指向一些有影响力的风险平价策略，这些策略是由布里奇沃特(Bridgewater)等对冲基金以及所谓CTA基金（专门从事基于计算机模型的衍生品交易的基金）开创的。
However, leverage used by risk parity funds tends to be concentrated in bonds, as prices for the securities have historically been less volatile than those for stocks. Performance for such funds has been poor this year, but there was no pronounced rise in bond volatility or the correlation between stocks and bonds in August.
然而，风险平价基金所用的杠杆往往集中于债券，因为此类证券价格的波动性传统上比股票低一些。今年以来此类基金表现一直不佳，但8月份债券波动性（或者股票与债券之间的关联度）并未显著上升。
JPMorgan also found that CTA strategies posted a small gain in the third week of August, when the sell-off occurred. Such performance suggests they were positioned ahead of the decline, so trades were unlikely to amplify market moves.
摩根大通还发现，CTA策略在8月第三周（抛售发生时）带来了小幅增值。这样的表现似乎说明，它们在股市下跌之前就做好了布局，因此相关交易不太可能放大市场波动。
Equity betas for balanced mutual funds are close to historical lows, but those for hedge funds still have room to fall further, Mr Panigirtzoglou said.
摩根大通的潘尼吉左格鲁表示，平衡型共同基金的股票贝塔系数接近历史低点，但对冲基金的贝塔系数仍有进一步下滑空间。
There is also the question whether the correction reflects a reassessment of the outlook for the economic cycle and stock prices.
还有一个问题是，股市调整是否反映了市场对经济周期和股价前景作出重新评估？
“Cyclical risk became market risk in August,” said Andrew Lapthorne, strategist for Société Générale. He said that attention was now focused on the extent to which any turn in the economic cycle starts to affect the availability of credit.
“周期性风险成了8月的市场风险，”法国兴业银行(Société Générale)策略师安德鲁拉普索恩(Andrew Lapthorne)表示。他表示，现在各方关注的是，经济周期的改变在什么程度上开始影响信贷的可获得性。
HONG KONG — China’s industrial slowdown is showing signs of sharpening, as its trade slump deepened further in August amid weaker demand from overseas buyers.
香港——由于海外买家需求进一步疲软，中国8月份的对外贸易下滑加剧，工业增长放缓的迹象愈加明显。
Once seemingly indomitable as the world’s workshop, China is now facing its most protracted declines since the global financial crisis, with overseas shipments falling 5.5 percent last month compared with a year earlier. That has dragged total exports 1.4 percent lower in dollar terms in the first eight months of the year.
曾几何时，中国似乎是一家顽强不屈的世界工厂，而目前正面临自全球金融危机以来最持久的经济下滑，上月按美元计价的出口商品总值与去年同期相比下降了5.5％。这使得今年头8个月按美元计价的出口总值降低了1.4％。
It is a sign that the country’s sprawling manufacturing sector is losing competitiveness: Labor costs are rising relentlessly and the currency, the renminbi, remains relatively strong despite its devaluation last month. The currency move still left Chinese goods notably more expensive for foreign buyers than they were even a year ago.
这是中国庞大的制造业正在失去竞争力的标志：劳动力成本持续上升；尽管人民币上月贬值，但中国货币仍相对强劲。上月的贬值仍让中国商品对国外买家来说，保持在明显较高的价位，即使是与一年前相比。
At the same time, China’s imports are falling even more sharply, declining last month for the 10th month in a row, with a drop of 14 percent by value.
与此同时，中国的进口下降幅度更大，上个月是进口连续下滑的第10个月，进口商品总值下降了14％。
The weak trade data rattled regional markets. Japan’s main stock index, the Nikkei 225, closed 2.4 percent lower, erasing all its gains so far this year.
中国疲软的贸易数字使亚洲地区的股市紧张。日本的主要股票指数日经225指数以2.4％的降幅收盘，回吐了今年到目前为止的全部涨幅。
In Shanghai, stocks initially fell more than 2 percent when the trade figures were released. But heavy buying in the afternoon set off a rally that helped shares close 2.9 percent higher.
在上海股市，贸易数字发布后，上证指数曾一度暴跌了2％以上。但是，午后的大量购入让股市出现反弹，反弹帮助上证指数以2.9％的涨幅收盘。
That pattern has been seen often in recent weeks, as China’s government appears to continue to try to support the country’s slumping stock markets. State brokerages last week pledged to contribute an additional 100 billion renminbi, or about $16 billion, to China’s stock bailout fund.
随着中国政府看来继续其支撑国内低迷股市的尝试，股市的这种交易模式在最近几周很常见。国家券商上周做出保证，将为中国股市的救市基金追加1000亿元人民币（约合160亿美元）的资金。
Economists say sharp drops in global prices for commodities like oil and industrial metals have propelled the decline in import value. But the sheer volume of imports of crucial industrial raw materials like coal, iron ore, copper, aluminum and steel has also fallen this year. The declines are a clear sign of weakening domestic demand in China as a slump in manufacturing and new housing construction drag on economic growth.
经济学家表示，石油和工业金属等大宗商品的全球价格急剧下降也推动了进口总值的下降。但是，诸如煤、铁矿石、铜、铝和钢材等关键工业原料的宏大进口规模今年也在下降。这种下降是中国国内需求低迷的一个明显标志，中国经济增长放缓的主要原因是中国制造业和新住房建设骤减。
Beck Cai, a sales manager at the Shanghai Steel Fashion Industrial Company, a manufacturer and exporter of prefabricated steel structures, said his company’s business in August dipped as much as 40 percent compared with a year earlier.
预制钢结构制造商和出口商上海森奉实业有限公司(Shanghai Steel Fashion Industrial Company)的销售经理贝克·蔡(Beck Cai)说，公司8月份的业务，与去年同期相比，减少了40％。
“I don’t think it has anything to do with the way we operate; it is mainly that the overall environment is slowing down,” Mr. Cai said. “As far as the recent devaluation of the renminbi, it is still too early to tell how it will impact our business.”
“我不觉得这与我们的运作方式有什么关系；主要是整体经济环境明显放缓，”蔡先生说。“至于人民币近期的贬值将如何影响我们的业务，现在做结论还为时尚早。”
China’s leadership last month made the surprise decision to devalue the currency by about 3 percent, the renminbi’s sharpest drop in two decades. But China’s central bank has since intervened on a huge scale, propping up the currency further by selling dollars for renminbi.
中国领导人上个月出人意料地决定让人民币贬值3％，这是20年来最大的幅度。但那以后，中国央行采取了大规模的干预措施，通过抛售美元、购进人民币，再次推高了中国货币的价格。
As a result of this intervention, China is burning through its huge stockpile of foreign exchange reserves at the fastest pace on record. Reserves fell by nearly $100 billion in August alone, although that still leaves $3.56 trillion, the central bank reported on Monday.
这种干预的一个结果是，中国正在以创纪录的速度减少其庞大的外汇储备。据央行周一发布的信息，外汇储备仅在8月份的一个月里就减少了近1000亿美元，但仍有3.56万亿美元之多。
Still, analysts say the recent devaluation was probably too small to help China’s exports.
不过，分析人士认为，近期货币贬值的幅度可能仍太小，无法帮助中国的出口。
“The renminbi has appreciated substantially in real effective terms against a basket of currencies in the past year, which in relative terms makes China’s exports less competitive than in the past,” Ding Shuang, the head of greater China economic research at Standard Chartered, wrote in an email. “But China still registered huge trade surplus and there is no reason for significant devaluation against most currencies.”
“在过去的一年里，人民币对一篮子货币的有效实际汇率大幅增长，这使得中国的出口相对来说比过去的竞争力下降，”渣打银行大中华区研究部主管丁爽在一封电子邮件中写道。“但中国仍有巨额贸易顺差，没有理由认为人民币将会对大多数货币出现大幅贬值。”
China’s trade surplus with the rest of the world has surged, rising to $365 billion in the first eight months of the year. This is because imports are declining more sharply than exports.
中国对外贸易顺差激增，总值上升到今年头8个月的2.23万亿元。这是因为进口下降幅度明显地高于出口。
But the trade surplus also helps soften the blow of investors’ pulling money out of China amid expectations that the renminbi will weaken further.
但贸易顺差也有助于缓解人民币的贬值压力，这种压力来自投资者因预期人民币将进一步走软而把资金撤出中国的做法。
Analysts at Nomura calculate the pressure on China’s currency to weaken is stronger now than at any time since 1994, when the country adopted its modern exchange rate system and devalued the currency by a third.
据野村证券分析师的计算，中国货币现在面临着比1994年以来的任何时候都大的贬值压力，中国在1994年引入了目前使用的现代化汇率制度，当时曾让人民币贬值了三分之一。
“Given the Chinese economy’s weak growth and deep-seated structural challenges, we expect renminbi depreciation pressure to remain,” the Nomura analysts wrote in a research note on Tuesday. “However, unlike in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we expect this pressure to be moderate and prolonged, rather than sudden and severe.”
“考虑到中国经济增长乏力、以及更深层次的结构性挑战，我们预期人民币贬值的压力将持续存在，”野村分析师周二在一份研究报告中写道。“但是，与20世纪80年代末、90年代初不同，我们预期这种压力是适度和长期的，而不是突然和严峻的。”
One potential complication in the August trade figures may be the exchange rate used by the customs administration. The administration said exports totaled $196.883 billion in dollar terms and 1.204 trillion renminbi in local currency terms.
8月的贸易数据可能存在一个让情况复杂化的问题，涉及海关总署使用的汇率。该机构称，出口总额以美元计价是1968.83亿美元，以本币计价是1.204万亿元人民币。
That implied an exchange rate for August of 6.116 renminbi per dollar, the same implied rate used in the July trade figures. But China devalued its currency on Aug. 11, and the average exchange rate in August, according to the central bank’s official fixing, was 6.3056 renminbi per dollar.
这表明，8月使用的汇率和7月的贸易数据使用的汇率是一样的，同为6.16元人民币兑1美元。但中国在8月11日让人民币贬值，而从央行发布的官方汇率来看，8月的平均汇率中间价为6.3056。
The reason for the discrepancy was unclear. But it raised the possibility that China’s actual decline in exports in renminbi terms was not as bad as the 6.1 percent decrease reported — or that the real decline in dollar terms might have been worse than the 5.5 percent drop reported.
出现这种差异的原因尚不清楚。但它提出了一种可能性，即以人民币计价的中国出口实际下滑程度可能并没有通报的6.1%那么严重，或者是以美元计价的实际下滑程度可能多于通报的5.5%。
Representatives of the customs administration’s press office could not be reached for comment after normal working hours.

Hillary Clinton is entering the final two months of the US presidential race clinging to a narrow lead in the polls while battling twin controversies over her health and her criticism of Donald Trump supporters.
希拉里?克林顿(Hillary Clinton)以微弱的民调领先优势进入最后两个月的美国总统竞选，艰难应对围绕她的身体健康和她批评唐纳德?特朗普(Donald Trump)支持者的两项争议。
On Sunday, the former secretary of state unexpectedly left a New York ceremony commemorating the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks after feeling “overheated”, her campaign said.
她的竞选团队表示，周日，这位前国务卿在感觉“太热”之后，出人意外地离开了纽约一场纪念2001年9月11日恐怖袭击15周年的活动。
While awaiting her motorcade, Mrs Clinton reportedly “stumbled off the curb and appeared to faint”, according to an unidentified law enforcement source quoted by Fox News.
福克斯新闻(Fox News)援引一名未具名执法机构人士的话称，在等候她的车队时，希拉里“在路边绊倒，似乎昏了过去”。
As the Democratic candidate was helped into her van she lost a shoe, which was retrieved by an aide, Fox reported. Mrs Clinton, 68, was driven to her daughter Chelsea’s nearby apartment where campaign spokesman Nick Merrill later said she was feeling “much better”.
福克斯新闻报道称，这位民主党候选人被扶入车辆，其间掉了一只鞋子，一名助理捡回了鞋子。汽车把今年68岁的希拉里送到了她女儿切尔西(Chelsea)在附近的公寓。竞选团队发言人尼克?梅里尔(Nick Merrill)后来在公寓里表示，希拉里感觉“好多了”。
Shortly before midday she appeared on television, walking from the building unassisted. “I’m feeling great, it’s a beautiful day in New York,” Mrs Clinton said as she emerged on the sidewalk. She smiled and waved to onlookers before entering her vehicle.
中午之前不久，希拉里出现在电视上，在无人搀扶的情况下走出了公寓大楼。“我感觉好极了，纽约今天的天气真好，”希拉里在人行道上现身时说。她向路人微笑和挥手，然后上车。
The episode comes after weeks of Republican claims that Mrs Clinton’s repeated coughing fits, which she blames on seasonal allergies, were evidence of undisclosed health issues.
发生这段小插曲的几周前，共和党方面声称，希拉里多次咳嗽发作证明，她存在未对外披露的健康问题。希拉里表示，咳嗽原因在于季节性过敏（但据媒体报道，希拉里上周五被诊断为患有肺炎，编者注）。
She had arrived at the ceremony shortly after 8am with the temperatures in the upper 70s and departed roughly 90 minutes later.
她在上午8点过后不久到达仪式现场，当时的气温接近70华氏度（26摄氏度左右——译者注）。她大概在90分钟后离开。
The incident, at least temporarily, eclipsed fallout from Mrs Clinton’s comments at a fundraiser last week that “half” of Mr Trump’s supporters belonged in a “basket of deplorables”, linked to racism, homophobia and islamophobia.
此事的影响，至少暂时超过了希拉里在上周一个筹资活动上发表的言论。当时她表示，特朗普的“半数”支持者属于“一群人渣”，带有种族主义、同性恋恐惧症和伊斯兰恐惧症倾向。
On Saturday, Mrs Clinton quickly apologised for saying “half”, though she repeated her indictment of her Republican rival’s extremism.
上周六，希拉里很快为自己的“半数”措辞表示道歉，不过她再次谴责了共和党对手特朗普的极端主义。
Shao Luwei tied an apron around her waist and started to skin and gut the squid. Without hesitation she finished preparing a plate full of squids in less than three minutes, after which she cut the seafood into pieces and threw it into a pan with heated oil.

It’s hard to imagine that such a skillful and flowing movement comes from a 22-year-old graduate. The accounting major from Yangzhou University has devoted herself to the homemaking industry, which is regarded by many as a promising but also challenging business.

半年前，邵露慰还在一家会计事务所实习，每天穿着正装，与数字打交道。但毕业前，她意识到自己的兴趣并非财会，而是家政。
“I used to baby-sit during vacations when I was in college,” she says. “I loved that job and my employers were always satisfied with me.” The memories of that rewarding experience made her abandon a career path that was closely related to her college major and enroll in a homemaking training program.
“大学时我常利用假期去做保姆，”她说，“我热爱那份工作，雇主们都对我非常满意。”正是这段收获颇丰的经历，让她放弃了和大学专业最贴近的职业道路，报名参加了家政培训课程。
“I had classes in etiquette, maternity nursing, cleaning and other aspects of homemaking,” she says. But she enjoyed the cooking course the most. “I knew nothing about cooking before, but now even my parents are surprised to see their little ‘princess’ cooking delicate food,” she says.
“我学习的课程涵盖礼仪、孕产妇护理、保洁以及家政的方方面面。”她说。但她最喜欢的要数厨艺课。“以前，我对做饭一窍不通；现在，父母看到他们的‘小公主’烧的一手好菜也不禁大吃一惊。”
Shao is the only college graduate in her homemaking training class, but she regards it as an advantage. “Apart from cooking and taking care of the employer, I can offer money management services, too,” she says.
邵露慰是家政培训班上唯一的一名大学毕业生，她认为这正是自己的优势。“除了做饭和照顾雇主之外，我还可以提供理财服务。”她说。
Uncertain future
不确定的未来
Despite Shao’s optimism, many professionals in the homemaking industry are concerned about college graduates’ passion for homemaking.
尽管邵露慰心存乐观，但许多业内人士仍对大学生投身家政行业的热情表示担忧。
“Well-educated homemakers seldom stay in this industry for long,” says Xia Jun, founder of Aijun Home Service based in Shanghai. “Many university graduates who work as homemakers soon look for another job because they only regard this job as a springboard.”
上海爱君家庭服务有限公司的创始人夏君表示：“高学历家政人员很少在这一行干得久。很多大学生家政人员很快便会跳槽，因为他们只把这份工作当做一个跳板。”
Zhou Wen, managing director of Zhengxianghe homemaking company in Guangzhou, believes that stereotypes held by parents and the wider society prevent college graduates from settling down in the homemaking industry. “Many parents can’t accept their child being a homemaker,” she says. “They tend to associate the job of being a homemaker with a nanny who only takes care of a child.”
广州正祥和家政服务有限公司总经理周雯（音译）认为，家长以及社会广泛持有的老观念阻碍了大学生扎根家政业。“很多家长都接受不了孩子从事家政行业，他们往往将家政同保姆联系在一起。”她说。
High requirements and demand
高要求、高需求
In fact, homemaking requires much more than doing simple chores. According to Wang Jianhua, secretary general of Chongqing Home Service Association, being a professional homemaker is not as easy as many people think. “According to national standards, homemakers are divided into primary, intermediate and senior levels. Each level of homemaker should meet certain requirements,” he says.
事实上，家政远非只做家务那么简单。重庆家政协会秘书长王建华表示，成为一名专业的家政人员并不像人们想的那么简单。“按照国家标准，家政从业人员分为初、中、高三个等级。每个级别的从业人员应符合一定的要求。”他说。
In order to obtain a senior level certificate, one must have at least a higher education and three years of homemaking experience. Besides, a comprehensive knowledge of household management, social etiquette, education and domestic entertainment is needed.
想要取得高级资格证书，至少要具备高等教育以及3年家政从业经验。此外，还应具备家务管理、社交礼仪、教育以及家庭娱乐等综合性知识。
These high requirements mean there is a huge demand in the market, with wealthy and foreign families looking for senior homemakers. Take Guangzhou as an example. Data released by the investigation team of Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference Guangzhou Committee on the homemaking industry shows that 20 percent of families in Guangzhou need senior homemakers, but only 14.6 percent of local homemakers meet the requirements.
高要求意味着高市场需求，富人和外籍家庭都在寻找高级家政人员。以广州为例，根据广州市政协调查小组发布的家政行业数据显示，20%的广州家庭需要高级家政人员，而只有14.6%的广州本地家政人员满足该要求。
Under these circumstances, Shao Luwei believes that she will seize the opportunity. “I think homemaking is a promising industry,” she says. “I will start from the primary level and gradually move up toward the senior level. My ultimate goal is to open a homemaking company of my own.”
在这种情况下，邵露慰认为她要抓住这次机遇。“我认为家政是个有前景的行业，”她说。“我会从初级水平干起，逐步提升到高级水平。我的终极目标是拥有一家自己的家政公司。”
College students are more concerned with building esteem than salaries when it comes to seeking jobs, China's leading job recruitment services provider has said.
中国领先的招聘服务供应商近日表示，相较于薪酬，现在的大学生在求职时更看重是否能获得雇主的尊重。
Guo Sheng, chief executive of Zhaopin Ltd, made the remarks at a year-end ceremony on Friday. The latest entrants into China's labor market are young people born in the 90s who have a different mindset about how to approach employment, he said.
智联招聘CEO郭盛在周五的年终晚会上发表了上述观点。如今进入中国劳动力市场的"新生代员工"多是90后，他们看待职场的观念与以往有所不同。
Both employees and college students agree that "respect for employees" is the most important when evaluating employers, but the latter demand more esteem, harmony and fairness, according to a report by Zhaopin Ltd.
智联招聘发布的报告显示，大学生和职场人两个群体均认为"尊重员工"在评价雇主时最重要，而大学生对尊重、和谐、公平公正方面的诉求更突出。
Students have showed a declining concern for salaries, but focus more on the management approaches by companies, the report said, adding that foreign-funded enterprises have become the first choice.
报告称，大学生对薪酬的关注有所下降，对企业内部的组织管理方式的关注度持续高涨，外企成为大学生求职的第一选择。
Employers should pay more attention to employees demands, both spiritually and financially, Guo added.
此外，郭盛还补充道。雇主应该将精力更多的放在应聘者的需求上，无论是精神需求还是经济需求。

Clear communication
清晰有效的沟通
Supervisors, however, are more demanding as far as the definition of workplace professionalism goes. “It is not about abandoning all your habits and being hypocritical. It’s about choosing the mode of behavior and expression that best suits each situation in order to ensure clear communication,” said Wang Han, deputy director of government affairs of Taobao.com.
然而，只要职场专业化的定义不断更新，企业主管们的要求也会越来越高。淘宝网政府事务办公室副主任王涵（音译）表示：“这并不是要员工放弃全部爱好并学会虚伪。之所以这样做是希望他们能在任何情况下都能选择一种最得体的行为表达方式，以确保清晰高效的沟通。”
Taking her own advice, Wang uses trendy slang to facilitate communication with her younger clients, while switching to more formal language in her dealings with older ones.
正是基于自己的建议，王涵开始使用潮流词汇从而加强和年轻客户的沟通。而在和年龄偏大的客户打交道时，她便会采取比较正式的口吻
Cao Yong warned that besides harming your professional progress, bringing “trendy” habits into the workplace may also give your boss a bad impression of you, and you may not even be aware of it.For example, Cao said he would question the work ethic and attitude of an employee whose signature was too cynical or maverick.
曹勇指出，把一些过于“时髦”的习惯带到工作当中，不仅会影响到你的职业生涯，还有可能会给老板留下坏印象，就连你也许都没有意识到这些后果。曹勇举例说，如果某员工的签名过于另类或者愤世嫉俗，那么他便会质疑该员工的职业道德和工作态度。
“After all, it’s generally accepted that it’s best to be serious and low-key in the workplace,” he concluded.
他总结道：“毕竟，人们普遍认为，在职场最好保持严肃认真、低调。”
It was probably one of the biggest entertainment scandals to hit last month – Kris Wu (吴亦凡), a former member of the South Korean band EXO, was accused of having a string of casual relationships with women who were left feeling hurt and used.
上个月娱乐圈爆出的一大丑闻，恐怕就是韩国EXO组合前成员吴亦凡被指与多名女性有染了。事后，这些传闻中的女主都表示很伤心，感到自己是被利用了。
Yet, what ended up drawing the most attention was not Wu’s arguably questionable lifestyle. Instead, it was what Wu’s fans were doing to support their idol: They posted malicious comments on the Sina Weibo account of the woman who first posted the accusations, and they declared their devotion to Wu, no matter what.
然而，最令人关注的却不是吴亦凡有争议的生活作风，而是其粉丝对他的声援：他们在第一个爆料吴亦凡事件的女生微博下恶语相向，表示无论如何都会力挺自己的偶像。
This incident has led people to believe that fervent fans are so protective of their idols that they can easily become aggressive.
这件事让人们意识到，这些狂热的粉丝对自己的偶像十分保护，且很容易就变得偏激。
In fact, it has been said that, recently, the idol worship some fans practice has become like religion. Fans are like pilgrims following a strict set of rituals – closely watching for any news concerning their idol, organizing fan bases and activities for their idol, and even spending their money to buy hundreds of copies of their idol’s albums to contribute to the sales totals.
事实上，人们发现近年来一些粉丝对偶像的崇拜已经近乎于一种宗教信仰。粉丝就像严格遵守一系列宗教仪式的朝圣者一般——密切跟进有关自己偶像的一切新闻，组织粉丝群和粉丝活动，甚至为了增加偶像唱片的销量，一口气买下几百张专辑。
“The internet-based model of ‘making a star’ is changing China’s economy,” financial writer Wu Xiaobo told GQ magazine.
“互联网上的造星模式正在改变着中国的经济，”财经作家吴晓波这样告诉男性时尚杂志《GQ》。
According to Wu, the traditional path to stardom was to first produce a good album or film, then receive media coverage, and finally get heightened exposure by becoming part of a trending topic. But the new model is completely different: Stars gather fans who are attracted to their looks and personalities and leave the rest – the marketing and media coverage – to their devotees.
在吴晓波看来，传统的星途是，新人首先要有一个好的专辑或者电影作品，然后获得媒体报道，最后由于成为热门话题而被高度曝光。然而如今的新模式却完全不同：明星们因长相和个性而吸引粉丝，然后将其余的市场营销和媒体宣传都交给其拥趸者来完成。
A changing demographic
从70后到90后：不一样的粉丝群
Not all fans appreciate the way celebrity culture is changing. Rolink Han, currently a student at UK’s Sheffield Hallam University, used to self-identify as a hard-core fan of Tang Yan, the actress of TV series My Sunshine (《何以笙箫默》,2015).
但并非所有粉丝都欣赏追星文化的这种改变。英国谢菲尔德哈勒姆大学的学生Rolink Han过去曾认为自己是电视剧《何以笙箫默》的女主演唐嫣的“死忠粉”。
Han said she resents fans who are quick to jump into quarrels. “They are too devoted to their idols to even think rationally,” she said.
Rolink Han称自己很讨厌那种一言不合就吵架的粉丝。“他们是偶像的死忠粉，根本就无法理性思考，”她说。
Han was drawn to Tang when she was still in the starting phase of her acting career back in 2010. Together with a large number of other fans, Han has organized various promotional activities, like parties for Tang’s birthday, over the past few years.
2010年，唐嫣还是一名演艺圈新人的时候，Rolink Han就开始喜欢她了。在过去的几年里，她和众多粉丝一起为偶像组织了各种推广活动，比如唐嫣的生日派对。
When asked what about Tang impressed her, Han said simply, “She is pretty and friendly.”
当被问起为什么喜欢唐嫣时，她的回答很简单，“她很漂亮，也很友善。”
Today’s popular idols, like Tang and former EXO member Lu Han, are mostly quiet and well-behaved. This may seem at odds with their target demographic: young people born in the 1990s and later, a generation largely depicted as rebellious and unconventional. But Li Songwei, a doctor of psychology at Peking University, has an explanation.
今天的大多数流行偶像，如唐嫣和EXO组合前成员鹿晗，都十分低调且彬彬有礼。这似乎和他们目标粉丝群的特征格格不入：他们的粉丝多为90后的年轻人，被认为是打破传统的叛逆一代。对此，北京大学心理学博士李松蔚作出了解释。
“The generations born in the 1970s and 1980s were brought up under the heavy restrictions perpetuated by mainstream culture, which is why they are more eager to challenge conventions and vent their oppressed feelings,” Li told GQ magazine. But the younger generation is different. “The post-1990 generation already lives in a relatively free cultural environment. What they long for are things that are purely beautiful, positive and innocent.”
“70后和80后的一代人受当时主流文化影响，成长环境中有许多条条框框。所以他们十分热衷于挑战传统，发泄自己压抑的情绪，”李松蔚告诉《GQ》杂志。但是如今年轻的一代就不同了。“90后已经生活在一个相对宽松的文化氛围中，而他们所渴望的只是美丽、积极而又单纯的东西。”
Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man, has announced his retirement, formally passing the reins of his $100bn retail, infrastructure and property empire to his elder son Victor Li after a decades-long apprenticeship.
日前，香港首富李嘉诚宣布退休，他在上周五正式把他的规模1000亿美元的零售、基础设施和房地产帝国的控制权交给了长子李泽钜。此前，李泽钜已经经历了数十年的“学徒生涯”。
The 89-year-old tycoon built his Cheung Kong group from humble beginnings making plastic flowers in the 1950s to a global conglomerate that owns 52 ports around the world, numerous energy and utility companies, the 3 mobile phone network and retail chains including Superdrug and Watsons.
现年89岁的李嘉诚白手起家，于20世纪50年代创立了生产塑胶花的长江实业集团。如今，他已把长江实业打造成了一个全球性帝国，拥有遍布世界各地的52个港口、众多能源和公用事业公司、3个移动电话网络，以及包括Superdrug和屈臣氏在内的零售连锁企业。
Known in Hong Kong as "Superman" for his dealmaking prowess, Mr Li said he would retire as chairman of CK Hutchison, his main holding company, and CK Asset, his property group. He named 53-year-old Victor Li as his replacement.
在香港因交易能力出众而被称为“超人”的李嘉诚表示，他会辞去自己主要的控股公司长江和记实业的董事长一职，并任命53岁的李泽钜接替他的职位。
A test of a succession plan that has been decades in the making, Mr Li's resignation is also a symbolic turning point for Hong Kong, where the economy has long been dominated by a coterie of tycoons.
李嘉诚的辞职，是对一项已酝酿数十年的继任计划的考验，也是香港的一个标志性转折点。长期以来，香港经济一直由一群大亨所主宰。
"No one can replace Li Ka-shing," said Joseph Fan, a professor of finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. "It remains to be observed how his retirement will affect the productivity and value of the Li empire."
香港中文大学金融学教授范博宏称：“谁也无法取代李嘉诚。他的退休将对李氏帝国的生产率和价值产生何种影响，还有待观察。”
Business associates paid tribute to Mr Li, who has a personal fortune of $34bn, according to Bloomberg, making him Hong Kong's richest man but placing him well behind Chinese internet tycoons Jack Ma of Alibaba and Pony Ma of Tencent.
生意伙伴们对李嘉诚给予了高度赞扬。根据彭博社的数据显示，李嘉诚的个人财富为340亿美元，这让他成为香港首富，不过他仍远远地落后于两位中国互联网大亨--阿里巴巴的马云和腾讯的马化腾。

Crystal Morrow’s first day as a DeKalb County 911 operator proved to be the ultimate test after the months of training she spent preparing for the job.
经过几个月的培训之后，克里斯蒂尔·莫罗成为了美国迪卡尔布县的911电话接线员。然而工作的第一天竟然是对她的一次终极考验。
During the first half of her Monday shift Morrow had answered several calls including one for a burglary in progress and another for a house fire. Then, just four hours into her day, she picked up a call from what seemed like a very familiar voice.
周一莫罗第一天上班。前4个小时里，她接到了数起报警电话，其中包括一起入室抢劫案及一起住房着火事件。就在她上班整整4个小时的时候，她接到了一通电话，而且电话中传出的是她非常熟悉的声音。
“I heard her voice, and I saw her name pop up on the screen. I was like, ‘Wait. This is my aunt,’” said Morrow. “I did freeze. Like I really, my hands froze over the keyboard but I knew I had to go ahead and get it in.” Her aunt was calling for help because Crystal’s father had gone into diabetic shock.
莫罗说：“我听到了她的声音，又在屏幕上看到了她的名字。我当时一愣，等会，这不是我姑妈吗？我整个人都僵住了，手停在键盘上，但我知道我必须马上接入这通电话。” 莫罗的阿姨的确是打电话来求助，莫罗的父亲因糖尿病发作休克了。
“Because of so many people being in the room, I didn’t think that I would get the call and it’s crazy that I got it on the very first day,” said the rookie 911 operator. While she was panicking inside, she learned from her training to remain calm and was able to process the emergency call with her aunt.
这位新手接线员感叹道：“房间里有那么多接线员，怎么正好是我接到这通电话，而且今天还是我第一天上班。”尽管内心有些恐慌，但经过培训的她告诉自己必须要保持镇定，这使得她能够专业地处理自己姑妈的报警电话。
Throughout the exchange, there was no indication that Morrow was distressed. Morrow walked her aunt step-by-step through what needed to be done and sent an ambulance to her father. The caller never knew that the 911 operator who was helping her was her niece.
在整个交谈过程中，莫罗并没有表现出紧张担心的情绪。莫罗一步步地告诉她的姑妈需要采取哪些步骤，并往家中派去了一辆救护车。莫罗的姑妈一直不知道与她通话的911接线员就是她侄女。
Danielle Harvey, Ms. Morrow’s colleague and the woman who trained her for the job, interestingly said that trainees are taught on the first day to field calls from family members. “She handled it well. She took the entire call.”
训练莫罗的是她的同事丹妮尔·哈维。哈维说巧合的是，受训者第一天接受的训练就是如何处理自己家人的电话。“莫罗干得不错，顺利完成了整个接听任务。”
A three year independent investigation into the September 11, 2001 attack on the Pentagon has yielded new eyewitness evidence which, according to the Southern California-based researchers who conducted the investigation conclusively (and unfortunately) establishes as a historical fact that the violence which took place in Arlington that day was not the result of a surprise attack by suicide hijackers, but rather a military black operation involving a carefully planned and skillfully executed deception."
近三年的关于911恐怖事件的调查有了新的进展，根据进行这项研究的南加利福尼亚的人员说，在阿林顿发生的暴力事件并不是恐怖劫持者做的，而是已经计划好的一场军事行为欺诈。
A CNN Reporter at the scene states that there is no evidence that a 757 hit the Pentagon.
一位CNN的记者宣称说根本没有证据能够证明波音757客机撞上了五角大楼。
What hit the Pentagon? A Boeing 757 loaded with passengers and fuel right? Who was on Flight 77? According to the Flight Information there were No Arabs on it. That makes me wonder if Flight 77 actually existed at all?
所以当时究竟是什么撞上了五角大楼？一辆满载乘客和燃料的波音757客机？而究竟飞机上又有谁？据消息称那上面确实没有任何阿拉伯人。所以这次航班真的存在么？
From the pictures and the videos, we can find that there are several doubtful points that need we take into consideration. For example, the marker line on the grass in the satellite and ground pictures, the different colour of the smoke, the hole which the plane impacted, and the standing pylons.
从一些图片和视频当中，我们也能发现一些值得推敲的疑点。比如，在卫星照片和普通照片上显示不同的在草地上出现的标记线，烟雾的不同颜色，经过飞机撞击建筑物上出现的洞和依然耸立着的架线塔。
Also, from the comparison of the different pictures, we can find some other strange points. For example, the gear is not the matching one. The wreckage of the plane is not the one from the American Airlines. The glass on the pavement of the pole is another doubtful point. The last thing need to consider is about the collapse. One of the gif video shows the plane impacting the Pentagon. The only problem with this video footage is that it has been altered and can not be fully trusted.
同样，通过不同图片间的对比，我们还能发现一些奇怪的地方。例如，残骸中发现的齿轮和飞机的本身并不想配。而且飞机的残骸似乎也不是撞击飞机本身的。从不同图片中看到的倒在人行横道上的柱子还有碎玻璃是另外一个疑点。当然还有撞击本身。有一个视频记录了这次撞击，但是问题是影片长度被更改了，因而视频当中的内容也不能完全被相信了。
These crash photos shown here clearly have been doctored and don't even match the physics of what happened. So where is the real video? It leaves many questions. I would think that some missiles could go Mach 6 in speed, so is this a missile? It is a real puzzle. It is a puzzle only if you take account that what you are indeed seeing is a missile not a plane.
所有在这里出现的图片都被篡改了，有很多甚至都不能很好的说明了当时发生了什么。那么，真正的视频在哪里呢？这给我们留下了太多的问题。撞上五角大楼的到底是导弹还是波音客机呢？这确实还是一个谜团。除非当我们真正看到那是飞机还是导弹。

An Apple employee is in trouble with his bosses after the prototype of its top-secret iPhone 5 was left in a bar... just as happened with the iPhone 4. The as yet unreleased gadget was supposedly 'misplaced' at Cava22, a tequila bar in San Francisco. Apple's security team was called in after reports that the gizmo had been sold over the internet for ?120 and a 22-year-old man was questioned. However, technology website Cnet.co.uk reports that the San Francisco Police Department said Apple had not reported the item as lost. Cava22 owner Jose Valle has said that neither the SFPD or Apple have contacted him, although he does remember getting calls about a lost iPhone last month. It follows a very similar incident in April 2010 when a then-unreleased iPhone 4 was left in a the beer garden of a German bar in California by an Apple engineer.
苹果前CEO乔布斯的离去，让“犹抱琵琶半遮面”的iphone5的期待值提上了新的高度，去年iphone4的问世前就出现了苹果员工酒吧弄丢未经问世iphone4的新闻，这一回iphone5的问世又一次“遭遇了原型机遗失酒吧”的泄露门。据悉，前日美国旧金山警方日前报案遗失一部手机，报道称，手机遗失在旧金山一家名为Cava22的酒吧中，该机在网上售价120英镑，警方接获报案后，苹果依据电子追踪查出手机位置，并会同警方至一22岁男子家中调查。但并未在该男子家中搜出手机，该男子也坚称不知情。然而报道发出后，苹果官方否认了iphone5原型机遗失，而酒吧Cava22老板也否认了苹果曾因原型机遗失而联系过他，这一则“似曾相识”的新闻让苹果的粉丝回忆起去年4月，iphone4发布前在加利福尼亚一德国酒吧被苹果工程师“被遗失”的新闻。
While there is not yet any official confirmation from Apple that the release of a new iPhone is imminent, there are widespread reports that an October launch is slated for the iPhone 5, around two months after this incident took place. That release date would be supported by images that appeared on the internet this week.
虽然，这一次的“泄露门”事件苹果官方并对此发布任何评论，而该事件是否会影响iphone5的10月发布我们目前还不得而知。万众期待的iphone5的山寨版已经是满天飞了，值得注意的是，为抗击市场上泛滥的山寨苹果产品，苹果近日特别成立了一支有着FBI背景的“反山寨”全球安全队。
201109/152548.shtmlFor the most part, Prince Philip takes bouts of ill-health in his stride. But confronted by the possibility that an untreated hip complaint could prevent him participating in his beloved sport of carriage driving, he has accepted medical advice.
菲利普亲王将治疗臀部微恙问题，但是医生可能会建议他不要参加心爱的架马车比赛。
The aim of today’s procedure is, however, twofold. It means, hopefully, he will be fit enough not just to take part in the Royal Windsor Horse show on May 9, but, crucially, to be an active participant at Prince Harry’s wedding ten days later.
治疗被分为两个阶段。菲利普王子有望参加5月9日温莎城堡的赛马车，更重要的是，也能出席十天后哈里王子的婚礼。
Both are key fixtures in Philip’s diary. Indeed, Harry favoured Windsor as his wedding venue because it would be easier for his grandfather to attend.
这两项活动都是菲利普王子的固定日程，哈里选择在温莎城堡结婚也是因为对祖父来说到温莎城堡更容易些。
Although he’s 96 and therefore the prospect of a general anaesthetic cannot be taken lightly, Philip remains supremely fit and remarkably strong for his age.
尽管已是96岁高龄，全麻实施起来也很艰难，菲利普亲王还是一如既往的健朗。
He still walks quickly with one hand behind his back, as of old. And he still cuts a dapper figure, with tailored suits and well-polished shoes; this helps give the impression of a much younger man.
步入老年，菲利普亲王依旧健步如飞，一只手背在身后，衣服剪裁得体，鞋子发亮，利落精干，看起来年轻不少。
Someone seeing him for the first time would not believe he’s a nonagenarian. The Queen Mother underwent two hip operation in her nineties. She had a hip replacement at 95 and then, at 97, had surgery after fracturing her left hip. She recovered to continue carrying out public engagements.
第一次见他的人绝不会相信菲利普亲王已经九十多岁了。女王的母亲九十岁的时候做过两次臀部手术，95岁做过髋关节置换，97岁左髋关节骨折后做了手术。康复后也一直出席着公共活动。
The Duke of Edinburgh, of course, has officially retired from royal duties but he still makes a point of showing up at events, often unexpectedly, but to the delight of organisers.
菲利普亲王也已退休，但仍会在各大活动中意外露面，让主办方惊喜不已。
He had hoped to join the Queen for the Maundy service at St George’s Chapel in Windsor last Thursday, and his name was in the order of service. He was also absent from the royals’ traditional Easter Sunday church service. The previous week he pulled out of a ceremony to hand over his role as Colonel of the Grenadier Guards to Prince Andrew.
上周四，菲利普本想和女王一起参加温莎城堡圣乔治教堂的濯足节，也在名单中，却遗憾缺席。复活节星期日教堂活动也是如此。前一周他参加了职位交接仪式，将自己近卫步兵第一团团长的职位交给了安德鲁王子。
The fact is that he has endured severe back pain for more than 20 years. It is the reason why, at times, he has appeared irritable in public. But the hip problem has become acute.
其实二十多年来菲利普一直忍受着巨大的背痛，这也是为什么有时候他在公众面前喜怒无常，但是眼下臀部的问题较为突出。
A close friend of the duke describes his condition as ‘the bones in his hip grinding together.’
有亲友说菲利普“臀骨都磨碎了”
Surgery, says the friend, does not intimidate him. ‘For him, it is a simple choice; if without the procedure it means he cannot continue carriage-driving, then it is worth undergoing an operation. He will only stop when he no longer enjoys it, not because he can’t do it. Above all he wants to remain active.’
但是菲利普对手术并不恐惧。“对他来说选择很简单，要是不做手术就没法参加驾马车比赛。这场比赛值得手术。驾马车是菲利普所爱，除非能力有限，不然他不会放弃。他还是想参加比赛的。”
When Philip retired from public duties last year, it was not for medical reasons – he simply wanted to enjoy more of his leisure time.
去年菲利普退休却不是因为身体状况，只是想好好享受闲暇时光。
Just a few days after Buckingham Palace announced the decision, he was carriage-driving at the Royal Windsor Horse Show.
这不，退休消息公布没几天，菲利普就参加了温莎王室驾马车比赛。
He turned 96 last June, and a week later helped the Queen celebrate her official 91st birthday at the annual Trooping the Colour parade. On June 20, he spent the day at Royal Ascot, where temperatures were so hot that the dress code in the Royal Enclosure was relaxed for the first time.
去年6月，菲利普迎来了96岁生日，一周后又和女王在军旗敬礼分列式上庆祝了她91岁的生日。6月20日，参加了阿斯科特赛马会，天气炎热，菲利普也是第一次在皇家禁地穿着不那么谨严。
Royal life has always agreed with him and most of his ailments and injuries have been sports-related.
菲利普一直很习惯王室生活，身体的各种小毛病也都是由运动引起的。
Philip suffers from arthritis in his right wrist, and broke a bone in his ankle playing polo. His arthritic wrist forced him to give up polo in 1971 – when he was 50 – after which he decided to take up carriage-driving.
右手腕患有关节炎，打马球时膝盖骨折。右手腕关节炎在1971年菲利普50岁的时候迫使他放弃了马球这项运动，随后菲利普又开始驾马车。
The duke is also an advocate of healthy eating combined with exercise. He once said he more or less followed the Atkins diet and he drinks only moderately.
菲利普也是健康饮食和锻炼的提倡者，他说自己时不时地在遵循阿特斯金减肥法，饮酒适度。
He takes the stairs – two at a time - rather than lifts, and still fits into the uniform he wore on his wedding day.
每天上楼都是两阶台阶一跨，不坐电梯，至今仍能穿上婚礼时的礼服。
But it is Harry’s wedding day in seven weeks’ time that has recently been on his mind. Says the friend: ‘With convalescence, he hopes to be there.’
7周后哈里的婚礼是菲利普近来的心头大事。朋友说：“他希望康复期后能参加婚礼。”
Prince Philip's final official engagement was hailed as "historic" by a Royal Marine - 64 years after the Duke of Edinburgh began his service to the British public.
自菲利普亲王受封爱丁堡公爵以来，为英国民众服务了64年，皇家海军陆战队（Royal Marine）高呼其最后一项公务“具有历史意义”。
The Duke attended the The Captain General's Parade at Buckingham Palace before retiring from royal duties. He was praised for his role as Captain General of the Royal Marines by a senior officer who described the 96-year-old as a "wonderful figurehead for all Royal Marines to look up to".
退休前，菲利普亲王代表皇室参加了在白金汉宫举行的总司令游行（The Captain General's Parade）。有位高级军官称赞菲利普亲王如同皇家海军陆战队总司令一般的存在，他说96岁的菲利普是“所有海军陆战队士兵敬仰的杰出首领”。
And as Prince Philip completed his final engagement, the watching crowd burst into applause while a band played the tune of 'For He's A Jolly Good Fellow'.
菲利普亲王完成最后一项公务时，围观群众爆发出热烈掌声，乐队奏起电影《特种部队：眼镜蛇的崛起》（For He's A Jolly Good Fellow）背景乐。
As consort to the Queen, the Duke has supported his wife in her new duties as sovereign, accompanying her to ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament in various countries, state dinners, and tours abroad.
作为英国女王的伴侣，菲利普亲王支持妻子在皇室的一切职责，与她共同出席多国举办的庆典比如国会开议大典（tate Opening of Parliament）、各种国宴和境外游。
He is also the patron of 785 organisations, particularly focused on the environment, industry, sport an education. "I tried to find useful things to do," he said about starting a footman training programme at the Palace. The Duke takes a great interest in scientific and technological research and development, as well as the conservation of nature.
]菲利普还是横跨环境、工业、体育、教育等领域785个组织的资助人。他在白金汉宫创立了足球运动员训练项目，他说：“我想做一些有意义的事情。” 他对科学技术研发领域兴趣浓厚，环境保护也是其颇为关注的领域。
He has been depicted as a tough but caring father, as well as an accomplished sportsman. A qualified pilot, the Duke gained his RAF wings in 1953, helicopter wings in 1956 and private pilot's licence in 1959. His love of the sea never waned, and he competed regularly at Cowes Regatta.
他被称作一位严格而慈爱的父亲和成就斐然的马球运动员，还是一名合格的飞行员，1953年入选英国皇家空军侧翼队员，1956年获得驾驶直升机资格，1959年可驾驶私人飞机。菲利普对海洋的热爱从未消退，每年都参加考斯快艇赛（Cowes Regatta）。
The Duke also helped the Queen through the deaths of both her mother and sister in the Golden Jubilee year of 2002. Philip's first ever private secretary Michael Parker, a friend from the Navy, once revealed: "He told me the first day he offered me my job that his job, first, second and last was never to let her down."
2002年时值伊丽莎白二世母亲和姐姐离世五十周年，菲利普帮助女王度过了这段时期。他的首任私人秘书，也是在海军陆战队的朋友迈克尔·帕克（Michael Parker）曾说：“我第一天上任时，菲利普就告诉我，他此生唯一的任务就是决不让伊丽莎白二世难过。”
Princes Charles, William and Harry are now expected to increase their workload, but Philip will still attend occasional official duties with the Queen.
查尔斯、威廉、哈里三位王子有望分担菲利普的工作，但是菲利普亲王仍将与伊丽莎白二世共同参与某些活动。
Films and TV shows are already effective at tugging our heartstrings or putting us on the edge of our seats.
电影和电视节目已经很大程度上的扣动着我们的心弦，让我们在座位上看得如痴如醉。
But new technology could be about to make the small screen a great deal more immersive.
但是新科技将会使看电视的人更加沉浸其中。
Researchers are developing ways of generating emotions through the sense of touch, smell and taste that could lead to what the designers are calling 9D TV.
研究者们正致力于研究通过触感、嗅觉和味觉来产生情感的方法，也就是制造所谓的9D电视。
While current cutting-edge 3D TVs help turn flat images into an experience that has depth and distance, it is often not enough to create truly compelling viewing, explained the researchers.
研究者们解释说道，现今先进的3D电视能够使平面图像具有深度和广度，使其栩栩如生，但却还不足以创造出真正激动人心的视觉体验。
Instead, the team based at the University of Sussex in Brighton is developing a system that uses bursts of air to stimulate different parts of the hand.
相反，在英国布莱顿苏塞克斯大学工作的一支团队正在研究一种系统，通过阵风，刺激手掌不同位置的神经，令用户产生各种情绪。
Separate regions of the hand have been linked with generating certain emotions - although the emotion triggered can depend on the location and force of the touch, for example.
比如，尽管所激发的情感取决于触摸的位置和力度，但手不同的区域已经与产生特定的情感联系起来。
The device being developed in Brighton, built by electronics firm Ultrahaptics, takes advantage of this research to touch hands in a way that conveys a range of emotions from happiness and sadness to excitement or fear.
超触觉电子公司制造了一种设备，现正于布莱顿开发，这项设备能够利用这个研究在一定程度上触摸手部，使其传达一系列的情感，从快乐和悲伤到激动或害怕。
It works by using ultrasound speakers to produce a flow of air that can be transmitted to a person's skin.
通过使用超声波扬声器，它能使空气流动，从而流动的空气能传输信号到人体的皮肤。
By using short sharp bursts of air to the area around the thumb, index finger and middle part of the palm to generate excitement, for example. To create sad feelings, the air is used to create a slow and moderate stimulation of the outer palm and the area around the 'pinky'.
例如用短促的风吹拇指、食指及掌心，令人产生兴奋感觉，或用慢而柔和的风吹手掌边及尾指，令人觉得伤心等。如果装置配合电视使用，相信用户看电视时会更投入。
The group is now starting to develop similar technology that exploits our sense of smell and taste.
这个团队现在开始研究类似的技术，使其能够开发我们的嗅觉和味觉。
The result would be a 9D TV that combines vision, sound, touch, smell and the five tastes - sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami.
而研究的结果将是9D电视，结合了视觉、听觉、触觉、嗅觉及甜、酸、苦、咸、鲜五种味觉。
Dr Marianna Obrist, who led the work at the department of informatics at the University of Sussex, said combined together they could bring all of our senses into the experience of watching television.
玛瑞安那·奥布里斯特教授在苏塞克斯大学信息系领导这项工作，她说道，9D电视将这些相结合起来，能够让我们在看电视时带动所有感官。
Early research by her team has shown that taste can be used to convey certain experiences.
这个团队早期的研究表明，味觉往往能够传达某种体验。
Participants in a trial study experienced sweet tastes as being 'smooth' or 'round' while sour was more 'spikey'.
参与尝试性研究的人们体验到，甜味较为平稳或是圆润，而酸味较为“尖锐”。
Similarly, her group found it could establish 'smell stories' for participants by finding smells they associated with particular experiences.
类似的，她的团队发现，他们能够为参与者建立“味道故事库”，也就是那些能和参与者的特定经历联系在一起的味道。
There are already some technologies that attempt to manipulate the sense of taste and smell, such as electrically stimulating the tongue or releasing perfumes to replicate certain smells.
已经有一些技术尝试去操控人的味觉和嗅觉，比如用电刺激舌头或释放香味来复制出特定的味道。
Dr Obrist and her colleagues presented details of their Ultrahaptics device to the annual Computer Human Interface conference in South Korea.
奥布里斯教授和她的同事在韩国年度计算机人机界面大会上展示了超触觉设备的详尽细节。
She said: 'Relatively soon, we may be able to realise truly compelling and multi-faceted media experiences, such as nine-dimensional TV, or computer games that evoke emotions through taste.
她表示，很快将能真正的实现引人注目的和多层面的媒体体验，比如九维电视，或是通过味道引发情感的电脑游戏。
'While the first four senses are already well established or emerging, I am particularly intrigued by the potential of taste and exploiting the taste experiences in a media context.
"虽然前四种感官体验已经得到很好的开发，我却对味觉的潜力很感兴趣，正试图在媒介环境下去开发味觉体验。
'Longer term, we will be exploring how multi-sensory experiences can benefit people with sensory impairments, including those that are widely neglected in Human-Computer Interaction research, such as a taste disorder.'
"今后，我们还会研究如何运用多感官体验造福于有感官缺损的人们，包括那些人机互动研究普遍忽略的人群，比如味觉障碍者。"
She said the technology could even be used to send emotions via mobile devices like smartphones.
她说，这项技术甚至能被用来通过智能手机等移动设备发送情感。
9 Threes. New Finals Record. Wardell Stephen Curry the Skyfucker, Second of His Name.
9个三分球，新的NBA总决赛记录。华德尔·斯蒂芬·库里的第二个名字：库昊。
Honestly the only bright spot was curry being curry again. This game was ass otherwise.Stephen Curry hits a miraculous shot at the buzzer!
老实说，比赛的唯一亮点就是库里做回了自己。否则这场比赛毫无亮点。斯蒂芬·库里命中了神奇的压哨球。
Steph could legitimately take routine advantage of a 4 point line. He's really one of a kind.He’s going to have every 3 point record in the book by the time he’s done. He’s so good to watch.
斯蒂芬可以合法地利用4分线的优势，他真是这类人。他似乎打算在退役时，有关3分的所有记录都是他的。他打球真的很好棒。
This shit more unfair than 2K.
这比打2K还不公平。
You know when Steph has it rollin that the crazy 3s are going in. FMVP hopefully. Steph Curry is making a very good case for finals MVP in 2018 if the Warriors prevail against the Cavaliers.
你知道当库里进入日天模式，这种表现FMVP是最希望的，如果勇士队能击败骑士队，那么库里便是2018年总决赛FMVP的最佳人选。
This is actually less likely to happen in 2k than it is for steph tbh lol.Even if you're a pure Sharp with HoF limitless. Over dribbled + smothered + pull up, you'd brick that 9.9/10 times and then get hit with a bad shot selection teammate grade drop.
事实上，这种事情更可能发生在库里身上而不是2K。即使你是无限制用名人堂球员的专家。过度的运球＋投篮受干扰＋干拔，10次中的9次投篮你将会打铁，然后选择一个糟糕的投篮，你的比赛评分就会下降。
Steph Curry is a Golden god and a 5 star man!
斯蒂芬·库里是金州上帝，五星好男人！
His shooting hand were chiseled by the Gods themselves!
他的投篮手是上帝自己凿刻出来的！
Seriously, this guy makes some of the most ridiculous fucking shots. For any other player in history this is a horrible shot, for Curry... it's still a horrible shot but still goes in at an alarming rate.
说真的，这个家伙投出了很多最荒唐的投篮。对于历史上的任何其他球员来说都是一次糟糕的投篮选择，对于库里来说……也是糟糕的选择，但他依然投出令人咋舌的命中率。
My mom, who reluctantly agreed to watch this game and never gets excited by basketball, yelled and jumped out of her seat when this happened. Incredible.
我妈妈不情愿地同意观看这场比赛，她从不因篮球而兴奋，但当库里投出这种球，她却大声尖叫，从座位上跳了起来。简直不可思议。

You're watching the latest season of Orange is the New Black on Netflix when, all of a sudden, the video jerks to a stop—and the endless buffering begins. It's frustrating when your network slows down, but there are a few tricks you can use boost your Wi-Fi signal.
你在看Netflix最新一季的《女子监狱》，突然视频戛然而止，无休无止的缓冲开始了。网络速度变慢着实恼人，但有些小秘笈可以提升Wi-Fi信号。
1.DON'T HIDE YOUR ROUTER.
1.不要把路由器藏起来
Most people hide their routers because they're unsightly or in the way, but placing a router in a closet is a one-way ticket to slow Wi-Fi: Walls and doors can degrade and absorb signal strength. Find a central location in your home and put your router on a table or bookshelf. Because some routers are designed to project a Wi-Fi signal slightly downward, keeping it higher off the ground will evenly distribute a Wi-Fi signal throughout your home.
多数人会嫌路由器有碍观瞻，或因挡道占地方而把路由器藏起来，但把路由器放橱柜里只会减弱Wi-Fi信号：墙壁和门会吸收信号、降低信号强度。在你家找个中心位置，把路由器放桌上或者放书架上。因为有些路由器的设计是把无线信号稍稍向下发送，把路由器高置可以让信号在你家均匀分布。
2.STAY AWAY FROM APPLIANCES AND METAL OBJECTS.
2.远离电器和金属物件
Microwaves, cordless telephones, flourescent lights, and even other routers may interfere with your Wi-Fi signal.Place your router away from household appliances and set it to a different wireless channel and frequency. You should also avoid placing your router near metal objects, which can absorb signal strength.
微波炉、无线电话和日光灯乃至其它路由器都会影响你的无线信号。让路由器远离家用电器，设置不同的无线频道和频率。同样也要避免把路由器放在金属物件周围，因为金属物件会吸收信号强度。
3.RESET ON A SCHEDULE
3.定期重置路由
A majority of tech support problems can be cleared up by simply resetting or rebooting your router or modem on a regular basis. And if you buy an outlet timer, set the timer to reset your router once a day at an off-peak time.
多数技术支持问题只要定期重置路由器或者重启调制解调器就可以解决。你要是买定时插座，就设置好每天避开高峰时段重置路由器。
4.UPDATE YOUR FIRMWARE
4.升级固件
Running firmware updates is annoying and time consuming. But if you have an older router, those updates ensure your router's software is running at its best and most efficient. It's best to buy a new router every seven or eight years.
升级固件糟心且耗时。可要是你的路由器较旧，升级可以确保其软件高效有效地运行。每七八年就买个新路由器最好不过了。
5.ADJUST YOUR ROUTER'S ANTENNAS.
5.调节路由器的天线
Most routers have two adjustable antennas on top. If yours are parallel, it's time to switch things up and go perpendicular. Wi-Fi works best when signals are parallel to a device's internal antenna, which are horizontal in laptops and vertical in desktop computers. Internal antennas vary in mobile devices, depending on how you're holding them (in portrait or landscape mode). Keeping a router's antennas perpendicular to each other will ensure a solid connection between your home network and your smartphones and laptops.
多数路由器顶上有两根可调节天线。如果你的路由器天线是平行的，就该转动下，让天线相互垂直。无线信号和设备内置天线平行时运行最佳，而手提电脑内置天线呈水平状态，台式电脑是竖直的。手机内置天线方向不一，取决于你怎么拿手机（竖直还是横向）。路由器的两根天线保持垂直可以确保家庭网络和手机、手提都连得上且信号佳。
6.USE BEER CANS
6.用啤酒罐
The aluminum in beer reflects and extend the signal farther than the router itself.
比起路由器本身，啤酒的铝罐能把信号反射延伸得更远。
Remove the pop top and cut around the bottom of the can to remove it. Repeat the process for the top of the can, just below the mouth, but don't cut all the way around—make sure the mouth of the can is still attached. Then, from the bottom, cut down the middle of the can. Fan out the flaps to create a curve or parabola and turn the can upside down to stand it up. Stick one of the router's antennas through the mouth of the beer can and use a small piece of duct tape or blu-tack to keep it in place, then repeat the process for the other antenna. Although your router might look messy, your signal strength should greatly improve.
把拉环去掉，把罐底去掉。易拉罐顶部紧贴罐口的地方同样方式操作，但不要切断，确保罐口还连着。然后，从底部把易拉罐从中间破开，展开铝皮呈一定抛物线弧度，把易拉罐倒置支起来。把路由器一根天线从罐口穿出来，再用一小块强力胶布或者蓝丁胶固定住，另一根天线同样方法处理。尽管这样你的路由器看上去乱作一团，但信号强度会大幅提升。
7.PASSWORD-PROTECT YOUR NETWORK
7.给网络设置密码
Because home Wi-Fi speeds are dependent on how many people are using it at one time, a strong password is key: It will ensure that only authorized people are using your network. Select a password that is a hard-to-figure-out combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
因为家用无线网络速度取决于同一时间有多少人在用，强密码是关键：这样可以确保只有得到许可的人在使用你的网络。选难以破解的字母、数字和符号的组合作为密码。
8.AND STAGGER HEAVY BANDWIDTH USEAGE
8.阻止重度使用宽带者
If too many people on your home network are using heavy bandwidth at the same time, like playing online video games, watching Netflix, and downloading movies and music from iTunes, then your entire network will slow down for everyone.
要是同时间有很多人在使用你的家庭网络宽带，如在线打游戏、看Netflix、从iTunes下载电影和音乐，那么你整个网络都会速度减缓。
9.BUY A REPEATER
9.买台无线中继器
Most routers have a range of about 150 feet. The easiest fix to boost the signal in those rooms is to buy a Wi-Fi repeater, which can plug into any wall outlet and will increases a signal's range and strength.
多数路由器的射程在150英尺。增加信号强度最简单的方法就是买个无线中继器，可以插入任何一个壁式终端，能扩大信号范围、增加信号强度。

Metaphor - The heart of holistic learning is relating things together. Metaphors are literary devices that link two things that normally don’t go together. Come up with metaphors to describe more complicated ideas in simpler terms.
将事物采用比喻的方法记住——系统化学习的核心是将所有的知识关联起来，比喻是文学修辞的一种方法，它将两个平时没有关系的事物结合在了一起，这就能将负责的问题简单化了。
Ten Year Old Rule – Explain ideas to yourself as you would to a ten year old. Sure, this isn’t always possible in your last years of a medical degree or learning how to apply neural networks to computer AI. But the idea is that you should be able to “dumb down” an idea enough so it seems obvious to yourself.
十岁法则——自己将知识解释给假定只有十岁你，当然这种方法并不是什么时候都适用的，比如你是一名将要毕业的医学院学生或者你正在利用神经网络技术做人工智能研究；但是采用这种方法有利于你将问题简化到十分容易理解的程度。
Trace Back – Put away your books and start with a random fact or concept. Then relate that idea to another concept in your subject. Keep doing this tracing pattern until you’ve linked many ideas together. The Gupta Dynasty reminds you of ancient Greece which reminds you of Socrates, reminding you of Confucius…
跟踪返回——把书放在一边，随机选择一个概念或者问题，然后将它和书中另一个概念关联起来，继续下去直到你关联了很多知识点。比如Gupta王朝让你想起了古希腊的苏格拉底，然后是孔夫子。
Refresher Scan – Scan through information in your text book. Notice whenever you encounter information that you either don’t remember or weren’t 100% sure about. Quickly link that information back to existing ideas through viscerlization and metaphor. If your refresher scan is turning up more than a few points per chapter, you haven’t learned it thoroughly enough.
引用回顾——通过你的笔记回顾你所学的知识，但要注意当你遇到你没有100%把握的问题时，立刻采用全息化或者比喻的方法将这些信息联系起来，如果你发现回顾得到的信息过多，那表明你还没有完全掌握它。
Compress Information – Not all information works well for holistic learning. A common point cited to me is learning anatomy for first year medical students. Anatomy involves learning arbitrary Latin names for hundreds of different elements of your body. There often aren’t clear patterns and constructs, just a dry list of facts. When encountering information such as this, your goal should be to compress it. Find ways to group information into smaller chunks of memory through pictures or mnemonics.
压缩信息——系统性学习法并不是全能的。其中一个例子就是我在医学院一年级时学习解剖学，解剖学中涉及到数百个与器官相关的拉丁名词，这些名词并没有明确的派生关系和构词方法，而仅仅是一系列的毫不相干的词。当你遇到类似问题的时候，你应该采用压缩的方法，找出一种方法把他们分类成一些小组，然后通过图片或者联想的方式辅助记忆。
Write – Take a piece of paper and write out the connections in the information. Reorganize the information into different patterns. The key here is the writing, not the final product. So don’t waste your time making a pretty picture. Scribble and use abbreviations to link the ideas together.
笔记——用笔记的形式将这些信息的关联记录下来，将信息重新组织成不同的样式，但这里的关键是写的过程而不是结果。因此不要将你的时间浪费到制作精美的卡片上，你需要使用简写和连线把这些知识联系到一起。
Time spent studying does not equal learning.
More studying time won’t help if the way you are studying is flawed to begin with.
学习时间并不等于你学到的东西。
如果你从一开始学习方法就有问题，花费再多的时间也是于事无补。
Holistic Learning
Smart people don’t just learn better. They learn differently. While many students get caught up in memorizing facts, intelligent learners know to seek the bigger picture and connect the facts together. This form of learning I call holistic learning.
Holistic learning is basically the opposite of rote memorization. Instead of reciting lists of facts, rules or formulas, you seek to connect ideas together. Instead of having separate boxes in your head for geometry, algebra or ancient India, you deliberately link facts together, so they form a bigger picture.
系统化学习
聪明人不仅学的更好，而且学习的方法不同。当许多人在死记硬背的时候，聪明的学生则在寻找将这些知识串联起来的方法，我将这种方法称为系统化学习。
系统化学习是与死记硬背不同，与背诵公理、定理和方程式不同，你是在寻找他们之间的关系并理解他们。这就像将你脑海中零散的几何学、代数学和历史学组合在一起，形成一个体系。

There’s mania in China right now. Stock market mania. It’s a bull market—niu shi— and people are excited.
一种狂热正席卷中国。中国股票市场进入牛市，群情沸涌。
“It’s still not crazy, not crazy,” said an investment banker working in Beijing, who didn’t want his name used because his bosses don’t like him talking about the crazy stock market. “These days market rises too fast,” he reflected, “but still many of my friends think the market is undervalued in many sectors.”
在北京工作的一位投行人士说：“这还不算疯狂。”他不希望我们在报道中提及其名字，因为老板不喜欢他谈论疯狂的股市。他说：“这些天市场上升的过快，但我的许多朋友仍然认为很多板块都被低估了。”
The rally has been fast and furious. It started this summer when the state-run Xinhua news agency started trumpeting stocks, publishing eight reports over four days about low valuations. Other state media said a strong stock market should reflect a strong China. Right on cue, stocks took off in September and have never looked back. Boosted by an interest rate cut, the Shanghai market is up 25% in just the past month. It closed today at its highest level since November 2010 after gaining 50% since the summer.
中国股市上涨的又快又猛。这波行情始于今年夏天，也就是新华社开始为股市做宣传的时候。当时新华社在四天内发表了八篇报道，内容都和股市的低估值有关。其他官方媒体则认为，强劲的股市可以体现出中华强盛。随即，中国股市从9月份开始攀升，而且再也没有回落过。受央行降息鼓舞，仅上个月沪市就上扬了25%。周三收盘时，上证指数创下2010年11月以来的新高，今夏以来的涨幅高达50%。
“I would argue everyone in China is a speculative trader,” says Fraser Howie, co-author of Red Capitalism who’s worked as a broker and trader in Asian markets for 15 years. “Fundamentals matter far less than other markets. You see this by the violence of the moves in China.” He points out that nothing drastic in the outlook for China has changed: the new administration’s reform packages are just now being implemented; GDP forecasts have barely budged; those bearish on the housing market haven’t changed their tune.
《红色资本主义》（Red Capitalism）的作者之一弗雷泽o豪伊说：“我认为，中国股市里的每个人都在投机。” 豪伊在亚洲市场做了15年的经纪和交易工作。他指出：“基本面在中国的作用远低于其他市场。从中国股市的大起大落中就能看到这一点。” 豪伊认为，中国的前景并未出现明显变化：新一届领导人刚刚开始实施改革，对GDP的预测几乎未变，那些唱衰楼市的人依然持悲观论调。
While the long-term outlook hasn’t changed, the stock market is up 25% in a month as investors get excited by gains following gains. Margin accounts using borrowed money have multiplied, as have new stock accounts.
尽管长期前景未变，但一涨再涨的行情让投资者感到兴奋，中国股市在一个月内上扬了25%。融资交易账户倍增，新开立的股票交易账户也是如此。
Ge Tianyu is a graduate student who this month opened a margin account, allowing him to double his bet using the brokerage’s money. He waited a little while before opening it, he says, to make sure the bull market was in full swing. He uses technical parameters when he buys stocks, and never holds them longer than three days. By the end of last week, he says he had notched a 50% profit. “Speculative bull markets can make maximum profits,” says the 26-year-old.
26岁的葛天宇（音译）是一名大学毕业生，这个月他开了一个融资交易账户，从而得以使用券商的资金，把自己的交易规模扩大一倍。葛天宇说，开这个账户前他花了一点时间来确认市场已经全面进入牛市。他参考技术指标来买入股票，持有时间从不超过三天。他说，截至上周末，自己已经赚了50%，“投机性牛市能带来最高的收益。”
Four decades his senior, Wang Shuying trades stocks on her Meizu phone from home in Beijing. She puts about 60% of her money in stock funds; the rest she trades herself. She doesn’t focus on the bigger economy, she says, as it has little effect on the stocks she buys. She sticks to the industry she knows best: nuclear. Retired from the China National Nuclear Corporation, she bought 6,800 shares in SUFA Technology, Shenzhen-traded company that makes valves for nuclear plants. In September she paid 16.80 RMB a share; today it trades at 31 RMB.
66岁的王淑英（音译）用自己的魅族手机在北京的家里炒股。她用60%的资金购买股票基金，剩余资金自己操作。她说，自己不关注整体经济形势，因为这对她买的股票没什么影响。从中国核工业集团退休的王淑英选择了自己最了解的行业：核电。她买了6800股中核科技，这家深交所上市公司为核电厂制造阀门。9月份王淑英买入这些股票的价格是每股16.80元，现在的股价为31元。
She doesn’t think the bull market will last, but then again, she doesn’t much care: she’ll sell some of her stock by the end of the year hoping to earn a tidy 100% profit.
王淑英认为牛市不会持续很久，但她同样并不在意。她打算在年底前抛掉一些股票，并且希望盈利幅度能达到100%。
Wang Bin works for the state-owned energy giant China National Petroleum Corp., CNPC. He’s busy with his job, but when stocks go crazy, like they have recently, he starts tuning in. Wang, 36, pays closest attention to companies aligned with China’s industrial policies, such as nuclear power and artificial intelligence. Normally he holds stocks for half a year, but it’s not always easy. A couple months ago he bought shares of Shenzhen Aotexun, an electric power equipment firm, which have since tumbled by 10%. With the rest of the stock market rising, he’s a little miffed, but not deterred. “I think this is a field that has industrial policy support— it is no problem,” he says.
36岁的王斌（音译）是国有能源龙头企业中石油的员工。他工作很忙，但当股市像最近一样疯涨时，他就会出手。王斌最关注符合国家产业政策的个股，比如核电和人工智能。通常他会持有半年时间，但情况不总是那么顺利。几个月前他买进了电力设备公司奥特迅，目前这只股票下跌了10%。看着其他股票节节攀升，王斌有点儿恼火，但并不害怕。他说：“我觉得这个领域有产业政策支持，没问题。”
When Western readers hear that retail investors account for 60-80% of the trading in China, they might think of the mom and pop investors portrayed at home—the grandmas investing their pensions, the local manager investing for his kid’s college fund.
当西方读者听说个人投资者占中国股市成交额的60-80%时，他们可能会想到自己的那些股民同胞——用养老金投资的老奶奶，把孩子上大学的钱投入股市的经理人。
While a sliver of that exists in China, the author Howie has written repeatedly that the Chinese press omits the fact that stocks are a rich person’s game in the country.
虽然中国也有一些这样的投资者，但豪伊反复写到，中国媒体忽略了这样一个事实，那就是中国股市是富人的游戏。
Seventy five percent of the individual stock accounts in China have less than 100,000 yuan ($16,000). The accounts with upwards of $1 million or more have a far greater push on the market. “When you start looking at value of those bigger accounts, the small investors’ effect is not as impressive as first appears,” he says.
在中国，资金少于10万元的个人股票账户占75%。而规模超过600万元，甚至更大的账户对市场的影响要比前者大得多。豪伊说：“看到这些大户的资金量时，小散户的作用就不像乍看上去那么显眼了。”
In the last bull market of 2007, when the Chinese market more than doubled in just seven months, one of Howie’s colleagues at the brokerage CLSA spent a week asking everyone he could find how they were investing. The number of those actually trading was minimal, but everyone had a story about a friend striking it rich.
2007年的上一个牛市中，中国股市在短短七个月里上涨了一倍多。豪伊在里昂证券（CLSA）的一位同事花了一个星期时间做调查，逢人就问对方如何进行的投资。真正进行了交易的人非常少，但每个人都说自己的朋友赚了大钱。
One of the places you can find some skepticism about stocks’ recent rise, ironically enough, is the very state-run press that earlier stoked enthusiasm. Last week Xinhua cited anonymous researchers predicting a pullback. A copy editor at the English-language China Daily, Huang Xiangyang, wrote a column wondering why China’s bull markets always seem to fizzle out soon after they start. “Based on global experience, returns on stocks are still closely correlated with corporate growth and innovation,” he wrote. “That may explain why bull markets in China never last more than two years, compared with as many as 17 years on Wall Street.”
充满讽刺意味的是，对股市近期上涨提出一些疑问的正是此前激起人们炒股热情的官方媒体。新华社上周报道，未具名研究人士预计股市将回落。《中国日报》编辑黄向阳也发表专栏文章，对中国牛市行情似乎总是在开始不久后便草草收场提出质疑。他写道：“全球经验表明，股票回报率仍和企业的增长与创新紧密相关。这也许能解释为什么中国的牛市延续时间从未超过两年，而美国能出现长达17年的牛市。”
Even so, he called this gold rush too good to miss. “In this market you do not have to buy and hold, as value investors are supposed to do. All you have to do is take the pulse of government policies and speculate on them.”
尽管如此，黄向阳仍认为这波绝佳行情不容错过：“在这个市场，大家不需要像价值投资者那样买入并持有股票。所要做的只是把握好政府的政策脉搏，并进行投机。”
Easy enough, for those able to get into the game.
对那些玩得起这场游戏的人来说，这的确易如反掌。（财富中文网）
It’s no secret: playing sports as a child leads to many benefits in adulthood. Take a 2012 report by TrueSport as an example. The program, which seeks to ensure a positive youth sport experience by promoting competition, sportsmanship and peak performance, celebrates the success that lifelong athletes gain. The report shows that being active on a team as a child leads to a laundry list of positives, including what the program calls the five “C’s”: competence, confidence, connections, character and caring.
这并非什么秘密：孩提时代的运动经历，会在成人后带来许多好处。以2012年体育赛事服务网站TrueSport发布的报告为例。这个研究项目试图通过宣传竞争精神、体育道德和最佳竞技表现，来肯定积极的青少年运动经历，以颂扬终身运动者取得的成功。该报告显示，少年时期积极参与体育项目的好处数不胜数，其中包括该项目所称的五个C：能力(competence)、自信(confidence)、人脉(connections)、品格(character)与同情心(caring)。
Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services praises sports for career benefits. “While it might be hard to argue that sports participation could guarantee higher incomes, promotions, and better jobs, the leadership skills and development of teamwork, hard work, and determination might help prepare students to be leaders at work and in their communities later in life,” the website says.
此外，美国卫生与公众服务部（U.S. Department of Health & Human Services）也赞扬了体育给职业发展带来的好处。该机构的网站写道：“参加体育运动可以确保更高的收入、升职和更好的工作，这一点可能没有什么异议。与此同时，体育运动培养的领导能力和团队合作能力，愿意努力工作和行事果敢的品质，也可以为学生在以后成为工作与社区生活的领导者，打下坚实基础。”
So it makes sense that business leaders at the very top of their field would be not only athletic growing up, but indeed some of the best in the country. Here’s a list of nine CEOs obsessed with a sport growing up – and successful in business, too.
所以，许多业内顶尖的公司领导者，不仅是运动员出身，而且有些人还是国内最出色的选手。以下九位CEO，在年少时便热衷于体育运动，并且最终也成为商场中的佼佼者。

A nine-year-old girl left America's Got Talent's judges stunned with her amazing rendition of Michael Bolton's 'How Am I Supposed To Live Without You' Tuesday night.
在上周二播放的《美国达人秀》上，一名9岁的小女孩以迈克尔波顿的《How Am I Supposed To Live Without You》震惊所有评委。
Celine Tam, from Hong Kong, first wowed the audience in June when she hit every high note in Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On.
演唱者为中国香港女孩谭芷昀。在今年6月份的时候，因唱准了席琳·迪翁《我心永恒》歌曲中所有高音节拍，一鸣惊人。
Celine Tam has one special fan in “Orange is the New Black” star Laverne Cox.
据了解，谭芷昀是出演《女子监狱》拉弗恩考克斯的一名特殊的粉丝。
With the actress guest-judging on “America’s Got Talent” on Tuesday’s episode, the 9-year-singer belted out a near-flawless version of Michael Bolton’s “How Am I Supposed To Live Without You.”
女演员拉弗恩考克斯在上周二担任《美国达人秀》节目的评委，而谭芷昀翻唱的迈克尔波顿的歌曲“How Am I Supposed To Live Without You”，近乎无暇。
Cox apparently couldn’t live without seeing Tam guaranteed passage to the live shows, so she pressed the golden buzzer. “I am really blown away,” Cox said.
很显然，考克斯决心让谭芷昀能晋级到决赛，所以，她按下了黄金按钮。“她确实打动了我，”考克斯说道。
The talented singer, named after Celine Dion, aced her previous “AGT” audition in June by singing Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On.”
这个小姑娘极富唱歌潜力，在之前“AGT”的视听环节翻唱一首席琳迪伦的《我心永恒》脱颖而出。
But this time the kid went with a Bolton classic, dedicating it to her little sis, who, yes, is named Dion.Celine came out golden.
但是这次她选择了波顿的经典歌曲，是为了唱给自己的名叫迪伦的妹妹听。谭芷昀的精彩表现触发了黄金按钮（一个季度才有一次）。
Jiajia, a third grader who was born with the congenital disease aplastic anemia, wrote an affecting article that moved many netizens.
今年三年级的佳佳患有先天性再生障碍性贫血，而她最近写的一篇感人的作文感动了很多网友。
In the article, she shared her biggest wish: to survive so she could take care of her grandparents.
在作文中，她分享了自己最大的心愿：要活下去，这样她就可以照顾她的爷爷奶奶。
Jiajia, 9, currently lives in the city of Suining in Sichuan province.
佳佳今年9岁，住在四川省遂宁市。
In the article, she writes, "My heart gets heavier each time I see my grandma weep for me. If I ever get to grow up, I will take good care of her."
在她的作文里，她写道："我看见我的奶奶为我的病落泪的时候，我的心情很悲伤。如果我能活着长大，我一定会好好孝顺我的奶奶。"
Jiajia contracted pneumonia when she was 4 months old. Since then, she has required a blood transfusion every two weeks.
佳佳在4个月大时得了肺炎。从那时起，她就需要每两星期输一次血。
After her parents' divorce, her grandparents took her in and confronted many challenges in the process of raising her.
她的父母离婚后，就由爷爷奶奶照顾她，而抚养她的过程中面临着很多挑战。
The girl's article was only 235 words long, and it was handed in as a school assignment.
女孩的作文只有235字，是交给学校的作业。
Nevertheless, Jiajia's words "deeply impressed" her elementary school teacher, who then posted the article online, where it struck a chord with many people.
尽管如此，佳佳的话"深深地震撼"了她的小学老师，这名老师随后把佳佳的作文发到网上，打动了很多人。
Up till now, a fund started by teachers at Jiajia's school has reached more than 30,000 RMB, which will be put toward Jiajia's future blood transfusions.
截至目前，佳佳学校的教师们已筹集到3万余元的善款，这能够让佳佳继续输血治病。
The two stock charts at right, comparing Apple's (AAPL) performance in 2013 to Amazon's (AMZN) and Google's (GOOG), tell a very different story than the nine bar charts below.
右边的两张图是2013年苹果（Apple）的股价走势与亚马逊（Amazon）和谷歌（Google）的对比，但对比结果与下面的9张柱状图相左。
Produced for Fortune by the reader who posts here as Merckel, the bar charts compare the three companies by more objective measures -- boring things like cash flow, return on assets, earnings growth and dividends paid.
这些柱状图是一位名为“Merckel”的读者提供给《财富》（Fortune）杂志的，使用一些较为客观的指标对三家公司进行了比较，包括现金流量、资产回报率、利润增长和已支付股息等枯燥的数据。
The three companies have different business models, of course. Apple makes big profits selling high-end consumer devices at premium prices. Google takes a tiny profit from each of billions of online ad sales. Amazon is constructing a giant virtual mall, pouring the profits from its established stores (books, electronics, etc.) into new ones. But putting a value on different business models is what the stock market does every day. Judging from Merckel's bar charts, what the market seems to be saying is that it believes Google and Amazon will keep growing indefinitely.
这三家公司当然拥有不同的业务模式。苹果通过溢价出售高端消费品，赚取巨额利润。谷歌每笔在线广告利润微薄，但在线广告总销量数以十亿计。亚马逊正在打造一个巨型虚拟购物中心，将现有店铺（如图书、电子产品等）的利润注入新店铺。
但股市每天要做的事就是对不同的商业模式进行定价。从Merckel的这些柱状图来看，市场似乎相信谷歌和亚马逊的增长永远没有尽头。
For Apple, it will believe it when it sees the next hit product.
至于苹果，市场还需要看到新一款轰动性的产品。
201401/272141.shtmlThe iPhone 5 will ship to eager Apple fans on Friday, September 21, according to sources close to Apple.
据与苹果公司关系密切的知情人爆料，热情的苹果粉丝们将能够在2012年9月21日星期五拿到iPhone 5 手机。
A Chinese source leaked the release date to a French website called App4Phone yesterday, providing the specific date.
一位中国消息灵通人士7月23日将这个特殊的发售日期透露给了一家名叫App4Phone 的法国网站。
The source also confirmed the new controversial port on the base of the phone, which will make older accessories obsolete unless a separate adapter is purchased.
这位消息人士同时证实了新机型将使用新接口，这将使以前型号iPhone的许多附件失效，除非老用户购买一个适配器。
We all know the phone as the 'iPhone 5', unless Apple decides on another moniker like it did with the iPad 3, which it officially called 'the new iPad'.
我们目前知道新的iPhone手机是“iPhone 5”，除非苹果公司采用另一个新的名字，就比如它将第三代iPad命名为“the new iPad”。
Other revelations include the headphone socket moving from the top-left of the phone to the bottom-left of the phone, and that the screen will be 3.75 inches.
其他的爆料包括耳机插口从手机的顶部左侧移到了底部左侧，同时屏幕增大为3.75英寸。
This is an increase on the 3.5" of previous models, but perhaps smaller than some fans might like, after being introduced to the 4.8" screens of models like the Samsung Galaxy III or the HTC One X.
屏幕将在之前3.5英寸的基础上拓宽，但也许比一些苹果粉丝设想的要小，他们原先认为新机型的屏幕将和三星 Galaxy III和HTC One X一样增大到4.8英寸。
The source was an unnamed Chinese accessory manufacturer, who claimed to have been given the date directly from Apple.So far, leaks from within Apple have suggested an October launch.
这个消息来源于位于中国的苹果配件生产商，他声称直接从苹果公司得到了这个具体日期。之前，有苹果公司内部透露的消息称iPhone 5将在十月份发售。
The new iPhone will have an even thinner screen thanks to advances in LCD manufacturing, according to reports.
iPhone 5 手机将有一个比原先更薄的屏幕，这要归功于LCD制造技术上的进步。
Tech blogs have long speculated on the demise of the 30-pin connector, which at 21 mm wide takes up a chunk of space, especially as the latest technologies such as microUSB offer more power in less space.
之前有很多科技博客已经预测了30针接口的消失，因为宽达21毫米的接口占用了一大块空间，特别是目前最新的microUSB技术已经能在更小的空间里提供更多的能量了。
They say that a smaller connector would give Apple more scope for new product designs or a bigger battery, or simply to make ever smaller products.
这些博主们表示一个更小的接口可以给苹果公司在新产品设计上更多的空间，或者可以适用一块更大的电池，或者可以简单地用来制造一个体积小一点的产品。
A weaker renminbi failed to stop a sharp fall in China’s exports in September, damping economists’ hopes that demand would pick up in the fourth quarter and sending markets in the region lower.
人民币的疲软未能阻止9月份中国出口急剧下滑，打击了经济学家对于需求将在第四季度出现起色的期望，压低了亚洲股市。
In renminbi terms, exports fell an annualised 5.6 per cent, according to China’s General Administration of Customs, the first drop since February when outbound shipments contracted 20.6 per cent.
根据中国海关总署(General Administration of Customs)的数据，以人民币计算，中国出口同比下跌5.6%，这是今年2月（该月出口同比下跌20.6%）以来首次下跌。
Imports grew only 2.2 per cent in local currency terms, down from 10.8 per cent growth in August.
而以人民币计算的进口则只增长了2.2%，低于8月份10.8%的增幅。
The outlook was bleaker when valued in dollars, with outbound shipments falling 10 per cent year on year, sharpening from 2.8 per cent the month before and far worse than the 3.3 per cent shrinkage forecast by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
若以美元计算，前景更加悲观。
A drop of 1.9 per cent in imports also came in well below expectations of 0.6 per cent growth.
9月份出口同比下跌10%，比上个月2.8%的跌幅更为剧烈，远低于彭博(Bloomberg)所调查的经济学家给出的收缩3.3%的预期。此外，进口1.9%的跌幅也远低于增长0.6%的预期。
The fall in exports adds weight to our view that the People’s Bank will maintain its recent policy of gradual trade-weighted renminbi depreciation in coming quarters, said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.
凯投宏观(Capital Economics)中国经济学家朱利安?埃文斯-普里查德(Julian Evans-Pritchard)表示，出口下滑进一步证明了我们的看法，即中国央行将在随后几个季度维持其近期政策不变，缓步将人民币贸易加权汇率贬值。
The central bank set the midpoint for the renminbi’s trade against the dollar weaker by 0.1 per cent at 6.72960 yesterday, in the fourth consecutive day of weakening.
昨日，中国央行(PBoC)把人民币兑美元汇率中间价较前一日下调0.1%，至1美元兑6.72960元人民币，这是连续第4天下调。
The Chinese currency has already depreciated 3.6 per cent against the dollar during the year to date to reach Rmb6.7291, the lowest since 2010, the same year the central bank abandoned its hard peg of about Rmb6.83 to the dollar.
今年迄今，人民币相对美元已贬值3.6%，至1美元兑6.7291元人民币，这是自2010年以来的最低水平，那年中国央行取消了人民币对美元约1美元兑6.83元人民币的硬性挂钩。
ANZ analysts David Qu and Raymond Yeung described the downturn in exports as broad-based, with shipments to all large trade partners dropping.
澳新银行(ANZ)分析师曲天石(David Qu)和杨宇霆(Raymond Yeung)称，出口下滑的格局是全面的，中国对所有大型贸易伙伴的发货量都在降低。
Exports to the US and EU fell 8.1 per cent and 9.8 per cent year on year, respectively.
中国对美国和欧盟(EU)出口分别同比下滑8.1%和9.8%。
The sluggish external demand will continue to weigh on the trade outlook, given downside risks stemming from the US election to the UK’s execution of the Brexit process, they said. We do not foresee exports being a growth driver of the Chinese economy over the next few quarters.
考虑到美国大选到英国执行退欧过程所带来的下行风险，疲软的外部需求将继续影响贸易前景，他们表示，我们预计在接下来几个季度，出口不会成为中国经济的增长驱动力。
Industrial profit growth in China eased visibly in September as sales softened and the basis for comparison became less favourable.
9月中国工业利润增速明显放缓，这是因为销售在减少，而且对比基数变得不太有利。
Industrial profits at large firms in China grew 7.7 per cent year-on-year in September according to the National Bureau of Statistics, down from 19.5 per cent in August when they hit their highest level since September 2013.
中国国家统计局(NBS)数据显示，9月份规模以上工业企业利润同比增长7.7%，低于8月19.5%的增速——此为2013年9月以来的最高增速。
The data put year-on-year industrial profit growth for the first nine months of the year at 8.4 per cent, holding steady from the previous month’s reading.
1-9月份，规模以上工业企业利润同比增长8.4%，增速与1-8月份基本持平。
The statistics bureau pointed to a decline of 0.8 per cent in existing stocks and a lowering by 0.6 per cent of leverage among companies as evidence of further improvement,
国家统计局指出，企业产成品存货同比下降0.8%，企业负债率下降6个百分点，表明形势进一步改善。
though it noted as well that production and sales had grown more slowly than the month prior.
不过，国家统计局也指出，生产和销售增长慢于前一个月。
While the bureau maintained its position that recent growth bore the hallmarks of recovery, it also acknowledged that domestic demand remained weak and warned of a need to remain on guard against corporate debt risk.
国家统计局虽然坚持认为，工业利润回归平稳增长态势，但也承认国内外市场需求总体仍然偏弱，并警告称，仍有必要防范企业债务风险。
China's automobile sales witnessed sharpest monthly decline in the past seven years in September.
9月份，我国汽车月销量创下7年来最大降幅。
China's automobile sales dropped 11.6% year-on-year to 2.39 million in September and the cumulative sales from January to September were 16.18 million with just 0.6% increase year-on-year, according to data from China Association of Automobile Manufactures.
根据中国汽车工业协会的数据，9月，我国汽车销量为239万辆，同比下跌11.6%；1-9月的汽车累计销量为1618万辆，同比增幅仅为0.6%。
Statistics show domestic automobile industry experienced 4% year-on-year negative growth in July, continued to decline 3.8% year-on-year in August and posted the double-digit fall in September.
统计数据显示，7月，国内汽车行业经历了同比4%的负增长，8月跌势延续，跌幅同比达3.8%，9月则出现了两位数跌幅。
All the top 10 automobile companies saw sales slump in September, except Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, the company whose sales increased 14.3% to 122,114.
9月，除浙江吉利集团外的10大车企销量均出现下滑。当月，浙江吉利的汽车销量增长14.3%至122114辆。
Sales of FAW-Volkswagen, SAIC Volkswagen and SAIC-GM, the top three automobile companies with a combined 27.3 percent market share in China, fell 5.4 percent, 8.6 percent and 18.4 percent, respectively, on a yearly basis in September.
一汽大众、上汽大众和上汽通用是中国车企前三名，占据了27.3%的市场份额。这三家企业的汽车销量在9月份同比分别下降5.4%、8.6%和18.4%。
Automobile industry has witnessed continuous growth in 26 consecutive years since 1992 and the last sharpest monthly drop occurred in January 2012 with 26.4% decline.
自1992年以来，汽车行业已连续增长26年，上一次汽车月销量大跌出现在2012年1月，跌幅达26.4%。
Chinese business sentiment pulled back this month according to a closely-watched survey - and executives expect business to remain in the doldrums for the foreseeable future.
一项受到密切关注的调查显示，中国企业信心本月下滑，企业高管们预测，在可预见的将来企业仍将处于低迷状态。
The MNI China Business Indicator showed sentiment fell in September, dropping 8.4 per cent to 51.3, a level last seen in July amid China's stock market turmoil. August's reading, meanwhile, was revised to 56, down from the originally-stated 57.1.
9月份，MNI中国企业信心指数(MNI China Business Indicator)下滑8.4%，至51.3，上次看到这一水平是在今年7月中国股市动荡期间。同时，8月份的数字被向下修正至56，低于最初公布的57.1。
But the worst news was that concerning future expectations. The indicator for this fell 11.8 per cent to 52.1, the lowest reading since the survey began in 2007.
但最糟糕的消息与对未来的预期有关。这一分项指数下滑了11.8%，至52.1，为2007年这项调查问世以来的最低值。
Still, any score above 50 indicates optimism outweighs pessimism. Philip Uglow, Chief Economist of MNI Indicators, struck an upbeat note, saying that most of the underlying components of the survey produced a better results than the final measure suggested. He said: Overall business sentiment is volatile, maybe not surprising given the current economic and financial backdrop. Dig a little deeper, though, and some of the core activity measures are performing better and are considerably up from the July lows.
然而，只要读数高于50，就表明持乐观态度的企业多于持悲观态度的企业。MNI指数(MNI Indicators)首席经济学家菲利普萠格洛(Philip Uglow)乐观地表示，调查中的多数分项指数的表现都好于整体指数。他表示：“整体而言企业的信心有些不稳，考虑到当前的经济和金融大环境，这或许并不令人意外。然而，再深入研究一下你就会发现，部分核心活动指标的表现要更好一些，而且远高于7月的低点。”
Moreover, companies have welcomed the yuan devaluation and continue to report improved access to credit. The survey contains a number of negatives, but even so, some of the intense pessimism surrounding China continues to look overblown.
另外，企业乐见人民币贬值，并继续报告称信贷供应状况转好。调查结果包含不少负面因素，但即便如此，某些人对中国产生的强烈悲观情绪仍显得有些杞人忧天。
Outstanding peer-to-peer (P2P) loans in China soared 153.5 percent year on year to hit a record high at the end of September, a latest industry report showed.
据最近一份行业报告显示，九月底，中国蓬勃发展的P2P借贷再次暴涨，借贷额同比去年增长了153.5%，达到历史新高。
Loans had reached 956 billion yuan (145 billion US dollars) at the end of September, according to P2P industry portal P2P001.com.
据P2P行业门户网站第一网贷的数据显示，截止九月底，P2P借贷总额已经达到了9560亿元人民币（约合1450亿美元）。
P2P lending -- lending without a traditional financial intermediary such as a bank -- has grown quickly in China as investors pursue higher returns and small businesses and individuals seek secure funds online.
P2P借贷不需要通过像银行那样的传统金融中介，P2P融资在中国增长十分迅速，其原因是因为投资者们追求高额的回报，而小企业和个人则希望在网上寻求安全的资金。
Lack of supervision has made the industry risky for investors and many P2P platforms have been implicated in shady fund raising.
由于缺乏监管，投资者们面临很大的行业风险，而且许多P2P平台都有私自募集资金的问题。
As of the end of September, there were 2,297 P2P platforms, 37.1 percent of the total, with operational problems, the report said.
这份报告显示，截止今年九月底，全国2297家P2P平台有操作问题，这一数字占据P2P平台总数的37.1%。
The average interest rate for P2P lending stood at 8.7 percent, unchanged from a month earlier and still near a record low.
不过P2P贷款的平均利率为8.7%，和前一个月相比没有变化，仍然接近于历史低点。
In August, the China Banking Regulatory Commission introduced new rules prohibiting P2P lenders from accepting deposits from the general public, preventing them from pooling investors' money for their own projects and capping the amount of individual loans.
今年8月份，中国银监会出台了新规，禁止P2P贷款人接受公众存款，从而防止他们为自己的项目募资、防止他们哄抬个人贷款上限。
China’s local-currency loans and broader liquidity grew more than expected last month but at rates nowhere close to the acceleration seen earlier this year.
上月，中国本币贷款和更广义流动性的增长超过预期，但增速远不及今年早些时候的水平。
New renminbi-denominated bank loans rose to Rmb1.22tn in September, up 16.2 per cent year on year after bouncing back from contraction to grow 17.1 per cent in August, according to new figures from the People’s Bank of China. That was also above a median estimate of Rmb1tn from economists.
中国央行最新数据显示，9月份新增人民币贷款升至1.22万亿元人民币，同比上升16.2%。这一数字要高于1万亿元人民币的经济学家预测值中位数。中国新增人民币贷款在8月份摆脱收缩趋势发生反弹，同比上升了17.1%。
A broad measure of the country’s money supply, M2, rose 11.5 per cent year on year last month, just shy of a median forecast of 11.6 per cent growth and marginally closer to a target of 13 per cent annual growth.
上月，中国广义货币(M2)同比增长11.5%，只比11.6%的预测值中位数略低一点，朝着13%的年增长目标又略微拉近了一些。
M1, a more narrow measurement of cash and shorter-term deposits, grew far more quickly at an annualised rate of 24.7 per cent year on year. Analysts said the discrepancies between M1 and M2 earlier in the year suggest companies still preferred to hold onto cash rather than invest.
狭义货币（M1，包括现金和较短期存款）的增长要快得多，同比增长了24.7%。分析师表示，今年早些时候M1与M2增速的背离表明，企业仍倾向于持有现金，而不是投资。
Still, Beijing’s favoured metric of total social financing, comprised of most major sources of financing, blew past a median forecast of Rmb1.39tn to reach Rmb1.72tn, up from Rmb1.47tn in August.
不过，北京方面最青睐的指标“社会融资规模”（由大多数主要融资构成）增长了1.72万亿元人民币，高于1.39万亿元人民币的预测值中位数，也高于8月份增长的1.47万亿元人民币。
Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard noted outstanding government bonds, whose share of credit is omitted from total social financing, were still growing rapidly at a pace of 57.9 per cent in September, pushing an augmented measure of the financing gauge to 16.7 per cent year on year growth, down slightly from 16.8 per cent in August.
凯投宏观(Capital Economics)中国经济学家朱利安?埃文斯-普里查德(Julian Evans-Pritchard)指出，9月份，政府债券（这部分信贷未计入社会融资规模）余额仍在快速增长，增速达57.9%，导致一项扩充后的社会融资规模指标同比增长了16.7%，略低于8月份16.8%的同比增速。
He added that “in coming months the economy may continue to propped up by earlier policy easing. However, a slower expansion in credit is likely to prove a major headwind to growth next year”.
他接着指出，“未来几个月里，中国经济或许仍会受到早先宽松政策的支撑。但明年，信贷扩张放缓很可能会对增长构成很大阻力”。
Chinese new home prices fell across the country in September, underscoring fears over the growth of the world's second biggest economy.
9月份中国全国新房价格出现下跌，凸显出人们对这个全球第二大经济体增长的担忧。
Prices fell in 69 of 70 cities in September from the previous month.
今年9月，被调查的70个城市中，69个城市的房价较上个月出现了下跌。
The overall price decline was 1.3 per cent compared to last September, according to a Reuters analysis of the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.
根据路透社(Reuters)对中国国家统计局(National Bureau of Statistics)发布的数据所作分析，与去年9月份相比，房价总体下跌了1.3%。
This slightly deepens the falls already seen in previous months. Chinese new home prices declined in 68 of the 70 cities in August, and fell across 64 of the cities in July.
这一跌幅略大于此前几个月的跌幅。今年8月，70个被调查城市中有68个城市的新房价格出现下跌，而7月份房价下跌城市的数目则是64个。
China's real estate sector is a major driving force for economic growth, as local governments who fund the infrastructure projects that boost GDP often rely on land sales to property developers for financing.
在中国，地方政府用基建项目拉动国内生产总值(GDP)，经常会依靠向房地产商卖地的方式融资，房地产业也因此成为中国经济增长的主要推动因素。
China's economy grew by 7.3 per cent in the third quarter, its slowest pace of expansion since the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009. Meanwhile, a slowdown in construction activity following years of frenzied property investment. Industrial demand has slackened to the point that steel in some Chinese markets is as cheap as cabbages.
今年第三季度，中国经济同比增长了7.3%，这是自2009年初金融危机以来的最慢增速。与此同时，在多年疯狂的地产投资之后，建筑活动的增长也已放缓。工业需求极度疲软，以至于在中国部分市场上，钢铁已经卖到了白菜价。
Last last month, the Beijing government moved to support the real estate market with measures including allowing second home buyers to make lower down payments.
上个月，为支持房地产市场的发展，中国政府转而采取了允许降低二套房首付比例等措施。
Chinese property developers have also resorted to increasingly imaginative tactics to shift unsold properties, including offering discounts to shoppers on Alibaba's Taobao website and even giving home buyers free chickens.
与此同时，为了将积压的物业转让出去，中国房地产开发商采取的销售手段越来越有想象力，其中包括向阿里巴巴(Alibaba)淘宝(Taobao)网站的购物者提供折扣，以及为购房者提供免费的活鸡等。
China’s export growth came in lower than forecast in September as an unexpected jump in the value of imports resulted in the country’s smallest trade surplus in half a year. But the latest data also showed the largest nominal trade surplus with the US on record, based on figures dating back to 1993.
9月份，中国出口增速低于预期，进口总值意外跃升，导致中国贸易顺差创半年来最低。但最新数据还显示，根据可回溯到1993年的数据，中国对美国的名义贸易顺差达到有记录以来最高。
The dollar value of outbound shipments rose 8.1 per cent year on year in September to $198.3bn, according to the General Administration of Customs, up from a rise of 5.5 per cent in August but missing a median forecast of 8.8 per cent from economists surveyed by Reuters.
根据中国海关总署的数据，以美元计，9月份中国出口同比增长8.1%，至1983亿美元，比8月份5.5%的同比增幅要高，但不及路透(Reuters)调查的经济学家给出的8.8%的预期中值。
Imports climbed more than expected, however, rising 18.7 per cent from a year prior to $169.8bn and outperforming a median forecast predicting growth in inbound shipments would edge up just 0.2 percentage points from August’s pace of 13.3 per cent.
然而，以美元计，9月份的进口增速超过预期，进口同比增长了18.7%，至1698亿美元，而预期中值为较8月份13.3%的增速仅高出0.2个百分点。
Growth in commodities imports remained robust in volume terms, with shipments of iron ore rising 10.6 per cent year on year to a record 102.8m tonnes. The uptick in shipments comes despite recent falls in the commodity’s price as authorities demand steel mills curb output to reduce pollution during the winter heating season.
大宗商品进口量增长仍然稳健。铁矿石进口同比增长了10.6%，达到创纪录的1.028亿吨，尽管随着中国政府要求钢铁厂在冬季取暖季期间限产以减少污染，铁矿石价格近期出现了下跌。
Analysts at ANZ suggested the rise was due to demand from Chinese steel mills for higher-grade iron ore. Looking at the broader picture for trade, they said a “lack of build in stockpiles suggests strong underlying demand, rather than restocking, was the main driver” behind the latest figures.
澳新银行(ANZ)分析师表示，进口增加是由中国钢铁厂对较高品位铁矿石的需求导致的。他们表示，从更宏大的贸易图景来看，“库存未增多意味着，强劲的潜在需求而非补充库存才是（最新数据背后的）主要驱动力”。
The jump in import value resulted in China’s trade surplus dipping to $28.5bn, down $13.5bn from August to the lowest level since March and counter to expectations it would fall just $2.5bn.
进口总值增加使得中国的贸易顺差缩窄至285亿美元，较8月份减少135亿美元，为今年3月以来最低，预期值是仅较8月份减少25亿美元。
However China’s trade surplus with the US climbed to $28.1bn in September, up almost $2bn from August and marking the largest on record not adjusted for inflation, according to data from CEIC sourced to China’s customs administration and reaching back to January 1993.
然而，根据CEIC取自中国海关总署以及可回溯到1993年1月的数据，9月份中国对美国的贸易顺差扩大至281亿美元，较8月份高出近20亿美元，为未经通胀调整的历史最高水平。
The nation's new yuan loans in September were largely supported by an increase in mortgage lending, but the contribution is expected to decline with tightened policies introduced in the property sector, economists said.
按揭贷款增量占据我国9月新增人民币贷款的较大比例，不过经济学家称，随着房地产行业紧缩政策的出台，这一比例预计将有所回落。
Chinese banks issued 1.22 trillion yuan in new yuan loans in September, up from 948.7 billion yuan in August, according to data released by the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
中国人民银行发布的数据显示，9月，国内银行发行的新增人民币贷款达1.22万亿，较8月的9487亿元有所增长。
New housing loans issued to individuals stood at 475.9 billion yuan, according to Ruan Jianhong, head of the statistics and analysis department at PBOC.
据中国人民银行调统司司长阮健弘表示，其中，个人住房贷款新增4759亿元。
In the first three quarters, China's new housing loans to individuals rose to 3.63 trillion yuan, or 35.7% of new loans.
今年前三个季度，我国个人住房贷款新增3.63万亿元，个人住房贷款增量占全部贷款增量的35.7%。
Zhao Yang, chief China economist with Nomura Holdings, said the tightened policy introduced earlier this month to restrict purchases would reduce the demand for mortgage loans.
野村中国首席经济学家赵扬表示，本月早些时候出台的限购紧缩政策将削减人们对按揭贷款的需求。
Yao Yudong, former head of the Research Institute of Finance and Banking of the central bank, said further monetary easing is not very likely.
中国人民银行金融研究所原所长姚余栋表示，进一步的货币宽松政策是不太可能的。
导读：也许就在一周之前，不会有多少人关注林书豪这个名字，尽管这个毕业于哈佛大学的美裔华人已经在NBA摸爬滚打了近两个赛季。如今，再度提起林书豪这个名字，不了解NBA的人也在津津乐道于纽约尼克斯队的六连胜和林书豪从板凳球员一跃成为耀眼明星的传奇故事。本文作者是一名华裔美国专栏作家，他笔下的林书豪是谦虚的、是自律的、是有精神力量的。通过阅读林书豪关于梦想的故事，我们每个人可能会得到一些收获。
If it isn't already clear from my last name, I'm an Asian-American. I'm small, and at times, I can be unassuming and meek. Like Yang, I'm not always so comfortable in my own skin. But there was some gravity in Jeremy Lin's performance against the Los Angeles Lakers Friday night. Every single one of his possessions had me on the floor, overwhelmed with pride and unfiltered elation. I'd never screamed so loud, and it'd been a long time since a single game moved me to tears. Whether it's been officially bestowed upon him or not, Jeremy Lin carries the hopes and dreams of entire Asian generations on his shoulders. I struggle to think of another moment where we as a community had been so proud of who we are.
可能你从我的姓氏中已经可以看出来，我是一个亚裔美国人。我很小只，而且有时我很不张扬、很温顺。和Wesley Yang（前文引述的一名亚裔美国作者）一样，我对我黄皮肤的肤色并不总是觉得很自在自如。但是这个周五的晚上，在林书豪对阵洛杉矶湖人对的比赛中，我感受到一种引力。他的每一次触球都会让我情不自禁的站起来，并且心中充满着自豪感和毫无修饰的激动。我从未叫喊得如此声嘶力竭，我也记不得自己上一次为一场体育比赛而落泪是什么时候。无论是否已经被大家强加到他身上，林书豪的肩膀上承载了几代亚裔美国人的希望和梦想。我很难再想出来另一个这样的历史瞬间：我们作为一整个社群，因为我们是亚裔而如此自豪。
No one really knows what to expect from Lin anymore. What was supposed to be a comedown game against the Lakers became something miraculous. We don't know how long he can keep this up, and for the many (myself included) who have been somewhat skeptical of this run, his play continues to suspend our doubt, almost force-feeding us reasons to believe. Perhaps the most tantalizing reason is Lin's probing of the lanes, providing us an almost unfair tease given the personnel around him and the image that conjures. Of course, he'd be taking cues from another unheralded point guard whose unlikely background made opportunities scarce.
已经没有人知道应该对林书豪有怎样的期待了。本该是一场一边倒的比赛（对阵湖人），变成了一个奇迹。我们不知道林书豪能够继续这样的表现多久；但对于所有在过去的这段时间里对他存有多多少少的怀疑的人们（包括我在内），他的表现一次又一次地让我们的怀疑无疾而终，几乎是用各种事实的证据逼着我们去相信他。
This phenomenon is more than just a celebration of points on the board, right? What is Linsanity? How does he affect the Asian-American community, and the community of Asian immigrants worldwide? What do we see in Jeremy Lin?
这个现象的背后，大家不只是在庆祝记分牌上的得分，不是吗？什么是Linsanity（疯狂的林想象）？他如何影响了亚裔美国社群、和全世界的亚裔移民？林书豪让我们看到了什么？
He's dominated Twitter for the past week, but the tweets that strike me the most are the ones attempting to lump Lin and Yao Ming together. No, Jeremy Lin is not an addendum to Yao Ming's legacy. No, Linsanity doesn't render Yao's time in the league obsolete. No one can replicate what Yao did as an ambassador for the game, nor will anyone be able to duplicate the refined artistry of his post game standing 7'6”. Yao was always a singular case. While he was very much his own person (who else could even dream of being Yao Ming?), it's impossible to separate Yao from China. His will was China's will. His effort was China's effort. He was built to serve his homeland; to propagate his two loves with the world: his country, and basketball. For me, that isn't what Jeremy Lin is about.
林书豪成为了过去的一周Twitter上大家讨论最多的话题，但最让我惊讶是那些试图将林书豪和姚明联系的评论。不，如果姚明给NBA所留下遗产是一本书，那么林书豪并不只是一页附录。不，疯狂的林现象也并不会让姚明在联盟中的时光被人遗忘。没有人可以替代姚明作为一个大使对这项运动所起到的作用。也没有人可以复制姚明身高7英尺6英寸却还拥有的优美的低位技术。姚明从来都只是一个个别现象。然而尽管他一直都只是他自己（还有谁能说要“梦想成为姚明”呢？），但是你不可能将姚明和中国分开。他的意志是中国的意志。他的努力代表着中国的努力。他被培养起来是为了他的祖国服务（举国体育），并宣传他在这个世界上的两个所爱：他的国家、和篮球。对于我来说，林书豪所包含的含义不一样。
"You are American!" my parents always tell me. They say so with smiles and sardonic inflection. I am. I'm American. I was born in California, I don't speak my native tongue all too well, and I've never been to any part of Asia (though I would love to). At a young age, I was taught essential Asian cultural doctrines, filial piety being chief among them. Respect your elders, and don't let them down. They've sacrificed everything for this one golden opportunity you have here in America. They've worked, prayed, and cried tears of blood for you. Don't waste time. Work hard, study, practice, be a good human being. I've seen my parents let down once before. I never want to see that again. We learn that sacrifices need to be made for the good of oneself and one's family. That may or may not include the dissolution of dreams.
“你是美国人！“我的父母总是这样告诉我，用微笑但带有嘲讽的语气。是的。我是美国人。我出生在加利福尼亚，我的普通话说得并不是很好，而且我从未去过亚洲的任何地方（尽管我很愿意去）。在我还小的时候，我接受了许多基本的亚洲文化理论的教育，其中最主要的是孝道。尊重你的长辈，不要让他们失望。他们做出了你可以想到的所有的牺牲，换来你现在生活在美国的这样一个黄金机会。他们辛勤地工作，祈祷，并曾经为你流下了血和泪。不要浪费时间。努力工作，学习，锻炼，成为一个很好的人。我曾经见到我父母失望过一次。我再也不想见到那一幕了。我们了解到，为了自己和家庭可以过得更好，我们必须做出牺牲。这当中可能包括、也可能不包括我们自己梦想的消失。
201202/171332.shtml
But I'm American! What do I have if I don't have dreams? The typical high-ranking professions are the gold standard for Asian parents. They're financially stable, a mark of prestige, and always hiring. But we don't all dream of being doctors, lawyers, and financial analysts. For those of us who don't quite fit those specific molds, we're stuck in crisis. We struggle in a tug-of-war between our ingrained ancestral identity —our filial piety, our duty to carry out the will of the family —and our own dreams. Some of us never find that balance, relinquishing our passions for a life built around crippling pragmatism or bitterly abandoning our ancestry completely. But some of us do find the balance to appease elements of our past, present, and future.
但我是美国人！要是没有了梦想我还有什么呢？那些“高级”的职业是亚裔父母评定好坏的黄金标准。这些职业收入稳定，是光环的标识。而且他们永远在招人。但我们并不都梦想成为医生、律师和金融分析师。对于那些并不能很好地被嵌到这些“模具”里的人来说，我们深陷危机。我们在一场拔河中挣扎：一边是植在我们基因中的华人的传统——我们要遵守的孝道和我们履行我们家庭的意愿的责任，另一边是我们自己的梦想。我们中的一些人从未在这场拔河中找到平衡。有些人在一种削弱人们意志的务实主义中忘却了他们的激情，有些人狠心地抛弃了所有我们祖先的传统。但我们中的一些人找到了这个平衡点，来平抚我们的过去、现在、和未来。
Jeremy Lin has done this, and it's why he's so important. He proves there's another way. Watching Lin knife into the lane and score over soaring giants, it's impossible to imagine him doing anything else with his life. But it could have been so different. His entire basketball career prior to this remarkable week has been a cyclical routine of underappreciation and invisibility. He could have left it all. We know about his Harvard degree in economics. But he had the courage and resolve to stick to his dream. And that's where the ethnocentrism melts away and the purity of his story emerges.
林书豪做到了这一点，这就是为什么他是那么重要。他证明了，有另一种方式。看到林书豪切入到内线，并在一群跃起的巨人的防守下得分的时候，我们很难想象他还能在人生里做些什么别的。但这个故事也曾经可能变得完全不同：在过去的这一周前，存在在林书豪的整个篮球生涯中的，只有周期性的、如惯例一般的被轻视和被忽略。他完全可以离开这一切。我们都知道他得哈佛大学经济学学士学位。但他有坚持自己梦想的勇气和决心。而就是从这一点开始，种族优越感渐渐地消失，他的故事开始显得那么的纯粹。
Jeremy Lin is humble, spiritual, and disciplined. He is also fearless, aggressive, and creative. He's found his mode of expression and his definition of success. Whether he blossoms into a legitimate NBA star or shatters his glass slipper sitting at the end of the bench is of little importance to me. Ethan Sherwood Strauss may be right. He may never exist as anything other than Jeremy Lin, the symbol — but only because the symbol does not stray far (if at all) from Jeremy Lin, the individual. Beyond the ability to galvanize an entire population of Asian-Americans or the ability to spin the narrative of the stereotypical Asian overachiever, what inspires me most is how comfortable he is with his abilities and his place among the best basketball players in the world — how comfortable he is with himself. While I was raised to believe in a culturally-assigned definition of success, more than ever, I have faith in my ability to form my own definition. If Jeremy Lin has proven anything, it's just how vital being true to oneself is.
林书豪是谦虚的、是自律的、是有精神力量的。他也是无畏的、进取的、有创造力的。他已经找到了他表达自己的模式以及他对于成功的定义。无论他今后成为一个真正的NBA明星，还是打破了他的水晶鞋、回到替补板凳的末端，对我来说都不重要。Ethan Sherwood Strauss或许是对的。林书豪的存在可能永远都只会限于“林书豪”这样的一个标志—但这只是因为这个标志完全没有偏离“林书豪”这个人。是的，他激励了整个亚裔美国人社群；是的，他改变了美国人对于典型的亚洲拼命三郎的描述；但是，林书豪带给我的最大的启发是他对于自己的能力的那种自在、以及他在与一群世界上最好的篮球运动员在一起时对于自己所处的位子的那种自如。尽管我从小受到的教育就告诉我，要相信不同文化决定了不同的对成功的定义，但是现在我比以往的任何时候都更相信：我们有能力给自己的成功写下定义。如果林书豪已经证明了什么，那么一定是“忠于自己”有多么的重要。
Lin has found his mode of expression; a force with the power to subvert preconceptions, a force that highlights the individual in positive and negative light, a force that can articulate dreams so vividly, fruition is the only plausible end. He's found it in his relentless forays to the rim, finishing plays with an improbable grace and flourish —something he's done long before the lights of New York shined down upon him.
林书豪让我们看到了什么？我们自己，以及我们生命中那些我们不曾真正相信的可能性。
What do we see in Jeremy Lin? Ourselves — and the options in life that we may not have truly believed existed before.
我是一个亚裔。我是一个美国人。我很小只，不张扬、很温顺。但我有我的声音，我有我对自己的掌控权。我希望有一天，我能自信地展示这个声音和这份权力。就像林书豪那样。
SEOUL, South Korea — The ACT college entrance exam was canceled on Saturday for thousands of students in South Korea and Hong Kong, after the test’s administrator said it had verified a breach of the testing materials.
韩国首尔——周六，在美国大学入学考试ACT的管理方称已证实考题泄露后，韩国和香港的ACT考试取消，数千名学生受影响。
The last-minute cancellation affected 5,500 students at 56 test centers in South Korea and Hong Kong, said Edward R. Colby, a spokesman for ACT. Students’ registration fees will be refunded, he said in an email.
ACT发言人爱德华·R·科尔比(Edward R. Colby)表示，最后一刻取消考试导致韩国和香港56个考试中心、5500名学生受到影响。他在电子邮件中表示，学生的报名费将被退还。
“ACT received credible evidence of the breach on Friday, June 10, and made the decision to cancel the test centers soon after,” he said. “This is the first known cancellation of an ACT test administration in an entire country.”
“ACT在6月10日周五收到可靠的泄题证据，不久后便决定撤销考试中心，”他说。“这是首次出现整个国家的ACT考试被撤销。”
News of the cancellation reached many students only hours before they were scheduled to take the test on Saturday morning. “Hotel expense, transportation fee, this is totally a disaster,” one frustrated Chinese student in Hong Kong wrote on Twitter.
很多学生收到考试取消的消息时，离他们原定于周六上午参加的考试只剩几个小时。“住宿费，交通费，简直是灾难，”一名在香港的中国学生懊恼地在Twitter上写道。
Overseas applications for the ACT and SAT exams are on the rise as more foreign students seek admission to American colleges. As more students take the tests, cheating on the exams has also become widespread in parts of Asia.
因为希望入读美国高校的外国学生增加，ACT和SAT考试的海外申请人数呈上升趋势。随着参加这些考试的学生增多，考试作弊在亚洲部分地区成了普遍现象。
In 2013, the College Board, which administers the SAT, canceled its test in South Korea after exam questions were leaked. It also canceled tests in China and Macau in January for the same reason. This month, a South Korean court fined students and officials of test-prep institutes up to 6 million won, or about $5,100, for selling stolen SAT test materials on the internet between 2011 and 2013.
2013年，负责管理SAT考试的美国大学委员会(College Board)在考题泄露后取消了在韩国的考试。今年1月，该委员会因为同样的原因取消了在中国内地和澳门的考试。本月，韩国一些学生和考试辅导机构的负责人因2011年到2013年期间在网上售卖外泄的SAT考题，被韩国一家法院处以罚款，最高金额为600万韩元，约合3.4万元人民币。
Adele has overtaken Michael Jackson to claim the fifth best-selling album in UK history. The singer's second album 21 has sold over 4,274,300 copies in the UK as of this morning (May 3)， which is 500 sales ahead of Michael Jackson's Thriller.
阿黛尔的个人第二张唱片《21》取代迈克尔。杰克逊的经典专辑《Thriller》，成为英国有史以来第五大销售唱片。截至到5月3日上午，《21》已经在英国卖出了4274300张，比《Thriller》的销量多了500张。
"To add to her many landmark records, Adele's achievement in overtaking Thriller in the all-time sales list is truly remarkable," comments the Official Charts Company's managing director Martin Talbot. "Thriller has long been recognised as one of the most iconic albums of all time - there is now no doubt that 21 can be spoken of in the same breath."
官方排行榜公司的常务董事Martin Talbot说：“阿黛尔的《21》取代杰克逊的《Thriller》的成为英国第五大畅销唱片是阿黛尔的又一重要记录，非常了不起。”“《Thriller》一直被看做是有史以来最伟大的唱片之一，毫无疑问，现在《21》也享有同样的盛誉。”
Since its release in the UK in January 2011, Adele's 21 has spent 65 weeks in the Top 10, with 23 of those weeks at number one. It has outsold Amy Winehouse's Back To Black to become the highest-selling UK album of the 21st century and won Adele six Grammys and two Brit Awards.
自阿黛尔的《21》在2011年1月在英国开始销售以来，这张专辑已经停留在排行榜前10名长达65周，并在其中的23个星期位居榜首。《21》取代艾米?怀恩豪斯的《Back To Black》成为21世纪最畅销的唱片，并为阿黛尔赢得了六座格莱美奖和两座全英音乐奖。
The UK's five highest-selling albums of all-time are as follows:
1. Queen: Greatest Hits
2. The Beatles: Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

Adele has finally broken her silence on her secret wedding to Simon Konecki.
阿黛尔终于不再对她和西蒙?科内切奇的秘密婚姻闭口不言了。
The singer, 28, decided to confirm their union while explaining the writing process behind her hit Someone Like You during her arena gig in Brisbane, Australia.
在澳大利亚布里斯班的演唱会现场，这位28岁歌手在解释大热的《一个像你一样的人》这首歌背后的创作历程时，决定承认他们之间的婚姻关系。
In a video obtained by The Sun, she told a rapturous crowd: "I could see in their eyes as they were listening to it on their headphones that it reminded them of something or someone and that's what I wanted to remember. Obviously I can't go through with those feelings because I'm married now. I've found my next person."
在《太阳报》记者弄到的一段视频中，她对痴迷的观众说：“当他们戴着耳机听歌时，我能从他们的眼睛中看出，这首歌让他们想起了某些事或某个人，而那也是我想记起的。但是显然我无法体验到那些感觉了，因为我现在已经结婚了，我已经找到下一个爱人。”
It was during her Album of the Year acceptance speech at last month's Grammy Awards in LA that Adele revealed she had finally married her long-term partner.
上个月，在洛杉矶的格莱美颁奖典礼上，阿黛尔在发表年度专辑大奖感言时曾透露说她最终嫁给了自己相爱多年的伴侣。
But the news reportedly infuriated members of her family, who were said to be anticipating joining the chart-topping singer for summer nuptials.
但是，据报道，该消息惹怒了她的亲友们，据说他们本来期望能参加这位最流行歌手的夏日婚礼。
A source told the Mirror: "Adele and Simon have a big family but some of those closest to them weren't aware of any impending wedding and were shocked to hear one might have gone ahead. They feel disappointed if it's true. They understand they're a private couple but are surprised to see them potentially cut out their loved ones."
有消息人士向《镜报》记者透露：“阿黛尔和西蒙有很多家人，但与他们最亲近的一些家人却不知好事将近，听说婚礼可能已经礼成颇为震惊。如果消息是真的，他们感到很失望。他们理解这一对儿行事低调，但知道他们悄悄地将爱他们的人排除在外，还是感到很吃惊。”
It has since been reported that Adele and Simon tied the knot late last year while they were in the US.
后来有报道说阿黛尔和西蒙是去年底在美国时结的婚。
Taking to the stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles the hitmaker had said to the audience: "Grammys, I appreciate it, the Academy, I love you, my manager, my husband and my son – you're the only reason I do it."
在洛杉矶的斯台普斯中心，这位红极一时的歌手走上舞台，对观众们说：“格莱美！我欣赏这个大奖！录音学会！我爱你们！我的经纪人！我的丈夫和儿子——你们是我努力的唯一理由！”
The Rumour Has It singer met 42-year-old Simon, who started Drop4Drop, back in 2011 - and the pair share four-year-old son Angelo together.
传言称歌手阿黛尔早在2011年就结识了42岁的西蒙——慈善机构Drop4Drop的创始人，他们一起养育着4岁的儿子安杰洛。
Confirming that the pair are joined at the hip, Adele was seen touching down in Sydney, Australia for the current leg of her tour with her sweet boy wrapped around her shoulders.
阿黛尔承认了两人之间的浓情蜜意，有人看到她目前飞到了澳大利亚悉尼开巡回演唱会，怀里抱着她甜美的儿子。
The Tottenham-born singer scored the prestigious Global Success Award at this year's BRIT Awards, after the successful reception to her album 25 - which sold over 20 million copies worldwide.
阿黛尔生于托特纳姆，拿到了今年全英音乐奖中尊贵的全球成功大奖，在此之前，她的专辑《25》获得了巨大成功，已在全世界卖出2千多万张。

Among those on the film jury were producer Tom Pollock, professor Jeanine Basinger, screenwriter Diablo Cody, AFI's Bob Gazzale and historian and critic Leonard Maltin. The TV jurors included writer-producer Steven Bochco and producer Richard Frank.
AFI will honor the creative ensembles at an invitation-only luncheon Jan. 14 at the Four Seasons Hotel.
本年的另一部大热，英国《国王的演讲》因不满足“美国本土电影”的条件，无缘十佳，不过AFI还是授予其一座特别奖。另外，引起广泛讨论的教育题材纪录片《等待超人》也获得了一座特别奖的鼓励。不同于其他的电影奖项，作为奥斯卡前瞻的重要指标之一，AFI不会在挑选出的十部影片之内再次排序，而一概视为年度最佳，颁奖典礼将于明年1月14日举行。
与此同时，AFI还遴选年度十佳电剧集，其中也包括了例如《广告狂人》，《欢乐合唱团》，《摩登家庭》等收拾不俗的热门剧集。
201012/120758.shtmlHeadphones let us escape to our own private bubble─which is not a good idea when walking, running or bicycling on busy streets.
耳机让我们得以沉浸在自己的小世界里──而在繁忙的街道上行走、跑步或骑自行车时，这不是个好主意。
This year's Consumer-Electronics winner, AfterShokz, addresses this problem with sports headphones that loop over the ears like other headphones but send sound waves through the listener's cheekbones.
今年的消费电子产品类获奖产品AfterShokz解决了这个问题。这款运动耳机像其他耳机一样挂在耳朵上，但却是通过佩戴者的颧骨来传递声波。
Environmental isolation is a serious problem; a recent study of pedestrian injuries found that three-quarters of people hurt or killed after colliding with a car or train were wearing headphones.
与周围环境隔绝是个大问题；最近一项有关行人受伤的研究发现，被汽车或火车撞倒后受伤或身亡的人当中，有四分之三的人戴着耳机。
By transmitting music directly to the inner ear, AfterShokz headphones don't block out sirens, warning shouts and other background noises.
AfterShokz耳机将音乐直接传送至内耳，而不会隔绝汽车喇叭声、警告的叫喊声和其他背景声音。
The bone-conduction technology used by AfterShokz was developed in 2001 by Shenzen, China-based Voxtech Ltd. to help soldiers in the field listen to radio-based commands while staying alert to their surroundings. A Voxtech unit, VoxLinc LLC of East Syracuse, N.Y., introduced the product in January.
AfterShokz使用的骨传导技术是由中国深圳的韶音科技有限公司(Voxtech Ltd.)于2001年开发的，用于帮助战场上的士兵听到用无线电发出的命令，同时又能对周围保持警觉。韶音科技的分公司VoxLinc LLC今年1月将该产品引入美国。VoxLinc位于纽约州东锡拉库兹(East Syracuse)。
AIG agreed to pay $960m to resolve a shareholder lawsuit that had demanded compensation – potentially exceeding $100bn – for the collapse in the insurance group’s value when it was bailed out by the US government in 2008.
美国国际集团(AIG)已同意支付9.6亿美元，就一起股东索赔案达成和解。这起诉讼案的索赔金额可能超过1000亿美元，索赔的原因是：2008年该公司被美国政府纾困时，股东曾因AIG市值大幅缩水而蒙受损失。
The class action suit was filed in 2008, shortly after AIG was rescued by the US Treasury and Federal Reserve as it racked up huge losses on insurance written on plunging mortgage securities.
2008年，就在这一集体诉讼提出之前不久，AIG曾因积累了巨额亏损而被美国财政部(Treasury) 和美联储(Fed)纾困。当时，AIG承保的抵押贷款证券价值一落千丈。
Shareholders led by the state of Michigan claimed they “suffered tens of billions of dollars of losses, at the least, based on false and materially misleading statements that AIG, certain of its executives, directors, underwriters and outside auditor made concerning the company’s financial results, business operations and condition”.
以密歇根州为首的AIG股东声称，他们“因有关AIG的虚假声明和具有极大误导性的声明而蒙受了至少数百亿美元的损失。这些围绕AIG财政业绩、业务运营和企业状况的声明正是来自AIG某些主管、董事、保险商及外部审计人员”。
AIG paid $960m to avoid the risk that the lawsuit would be successful and the company would be sunk again by bills that it could not pay. During the crisis it was collateral calls from banks such as Goldman Sachs that led to the company’s giant $180bn bailout.
AIG支付9.6亿美元，是为了避免这一诉讼可能会胜诉的风险，那将会导致AIG因为面临无法支付的罚单而再次濒临破产。金融危机期间，正是来自高盛(Goldman Sachs)这类银行的追加抵押通知导致AIG不得不接受1800亿美元的巨额纾困。
It is one of the biggest payouts of its type. Bank of America, another of the top bailouts of the financial crisis, paid $2.4bn in 2012 to settle a shareholder lawsuit, which argued the company concealed information about the financial health of Merrill Lynch, the securities group it bought in 2008.
在同类支出中，AIG支付的和解金额是规模最大的之一。2012年，曾在金融危机中接受最大规模纾困的另一家银行美国银行(Bank of America)曾支付24亿美元，就一起股东诉讼案达成和解。当时，美国银行的股东声称，该行在2008年收购证券集团美林证券(Merrill Lynch)时，隐瞒了后者的财政健康状况信息。
“We are pleased to resolve this longstanding dispute,” said AIG. “The resolution of this and other legacy financial crisis related matters better enables us to focus on AIG’s future.”
AIG表示，“我们很高兴能解决这一旷日持久的争端。这个问题及其他金融危机遗留问题相关事务的解决，将令我们能更好地把精力集中于AIG的未来上。”
The company has separately reached settlements with a string of banks, which it claimed bore responsibility for the toxic subprime securities which they sold and had insured by AIG.
目前，AIG已另行与一系列银行达成和解。此前该公司曾声称，这些银行对它们销售并让AIG承保的有毒次级证券负有责任。
However, not all its legal issues are over. A handful of individual investors, including the Kuwait Investment Authority, have sued the insurer and may choose to pursue their separate litigation.
不过，该公司并不是所有法律问题都已得到解决。包括科威特投资局(Kuwait Investment Authority)在内的几家个人投资者已向这家保险公司发起诉讼，他们可能会选择继续自行诉讼。
When I graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design, I got a job at a small industrial design firm in LA. I loved it at first – I had a job that paid well, and some of my designs even ended up on store shelves.
从罗德岛设计学院（Rhode Island School of Design）毕业后，我在洛杉矶一家小型工业设计公司找到了工作。最初，我很喜欢那份工作——工资优厚，而且我的一些设计还登上了商店货架。
But I felt unfulfilled designing products that would eventually end up in landfills, and wanted to build something that would last. I worked with a few entrepreneurs in LA, and it struck me that even though I was the designer, they were the ones that were creating something meaningful. I asked myself, ‘what’s the difference between them and me? Why can’t I do the same thing?’ That’s when I realized — they had taken a risk, and I hadn’t.
但仅仅设计一些最终进入垃圾填埋场的产品，让我感觉不到成就感，我希望创造一些更有生命力的商品。在洛杉矶，我曾接触过许多创业者，令我吃惊的是，虽然我是一名设计师，但他们才是在创造有意义的事物。我问自己：‘他们与我有什么区别？我为什么不能做同样的事情？’也就是在那一刻，我终于意识到，他们选择了冒险，而我却没有。
Then one day, I got a call from my college friend, Joe Gebbia. He had been telling me that I should move to San Francisco ever since we graduated, but this call triggered something for me, and I finally decided to take the risk. Everyone has one or two moments in their life when they make a decision and it changes their life forever. Almost every decision in my life I’ve now made is a chain reaction from the moment I decided to move to San Francisco.
有一天，我接到大学好友乔o杰比亚的电话。他从大学毕业后就一直劝说我搬到旧金山，但这一通电话却触动了我，我最终决定冒险。人总会在某个时刻做出一两个决定，进而彻底改变自己的一生。我后来的一系列决定，都是前往旧金山这个决定的连锁反应。
So I packed all of my possessions into the back of my old Honda Civic, and set off for to a city where it turned out I couldn’t even afford my first month’s rent. It was a risky decision, but finding a way to pay the rent is what ultimately led us to blow up a few air mattresses and rent out our living room to three strangers who needed a place to stay for the weekend. We called it the AirBed and Breakfast, an idea that eventually became Airbnb.
于是，我将所有财产装进了我那辆破旧的本田思域轿车(Honda Civic)，然后出发前往旧金山，结果到了那里才发现，我甚至承担不起第一个月的房租。这是一个有风险的决定，但为了想办法支付房租，我们最后吹起了一些充气床，并且把起居室租给了三位陌生人，他们周末住在这里。我们将这种办法称为“充气床与早餐”（AirBed and Breakfast），Airbnb这一名称就来源于此。
In our society, we’re conditioned to avoid taking risks at all the wrong times. Right after college, we’re told to do the safe thing, check all the right boxes, and keep our heads down. It’s assumed that once we find our footing or get a stable job, then we can try to swing for the fences.
在当今社会，我们习惯了在所有不适当的时刻避免冒险。大学毕业后，人们告诉我们要做有保障的事情，要做出正确的选择，要保持低调。人们以为，我们要站稳脚跟或找到一份稳定的工作，然后才可以尝试孤注一掷。
But that’s not how life works, and it’s the wrong way to think about risk. Inevitably, things change as you get older. You might start a family. You might run into unexpected obstacles along the way. And with each day that passes, taking risks will feel scarier, and seem harder, than ever before.
但生活并非如此，这样理解风险是错误的。随着年龄的增长，事情不可避免地会发生变化。你可能成立了家庭。你可能遇到了意想不到的障碍。随着时间的流逝，冒险会让人感觉更加可怕，看起来更加艰难。
So my advice is, don’t wait. There will always be plenty of reasons to play it safe. But more often than not, the most exciting times in your life will be the times when you take a risk – when you follow that gnawing feeling in your gut instead of the safe, cautious path suggested by others.
所以，我的建议是不要等待。我们总能找到各种安稳过日子的理由。但通常情况下，人一生中最令人激动的时刻，始终是你选择冒险的时候——你决定跟随内心那种痛苦的感觉，而不是选择别人建议的安全、谨慎的道路。
For me, it’s made all the difference.
对我而言，那次冒险改变了一切。
Within three months of being hired as chief diversity officer at Lenovo in 2007, Yolanda Conyers received some feedback that she was being disrespectful to her Chinese coworkers. Conyers, a perfectly polite woman from Port Arthur, Tex., was taken aback by the critique because she thought she had worked tirelessly to be polite to her new team.
2007年，友兰达o康耶丝（Yolanda Conyers）出任联想公司（Lenovo）文化整合与多元化的最高负责人，可是上任不到三个月，就有不少人反映她对中国同事不大尊重。康耶丝来自美国德州亚瑟港，待人素来彬彬有礼。在得知这一批评后，她大吃一惊，因为她自认为已极尽可能地对新团队礼数周到。
It turns out that Conyers efforts were getting lost in translation. She thought she was being very deferential when she sent emails to her senior colleagues to “request” a meeting. But the word request translates in Mandarin to a term that executives use when asking for a meeting with someone below them. Without knowing it, Conyers was telling her new managers that she thought she was above them.
原来，康耶丝的努力迷失在了翻译中。比如，在向公司上级发送电子邮件“要求（request）”开会时，她自认为措辞非常谦逊有礼——可问题恰恰就出在“要求”一词。在汉语中，“要求”是在领导找下级开会时才能用。由于对这一情况毫不知情，康耶丝无异于在向她的新老板们宣示她才是上级。
“It sounds small, but those small things can generate a lot of mistrust,” Conyers said in an interview with Fortune. “We had to go through a lot of effort to understand the different cultures within the company and the reasons people behave the way they do.”
“这看起来是小事，可这样的小事多了，就会产生很多不信任。”在接受《财富》（Fortune）采访时，康耶丝反思道：“我们要作出很大的努力，才能理解公司内部不同的文化，以及每个人行为处事的想法。”
Since 2005 when Lenovo bought IBM’s PC business, the Chinese company has gone on a spree of high-profile acquisitions. Most recently, the world’s largest personal-computer maker said on Thursday that it had completed a $2.91 billion acquisition of Google’s Motorola Mobility unit. The merger makes Lenovo the third-largest smartphone maker. Each time Lenovo buys an overseas company, its staff gets more diverse and its corporate structure more complicated. Today, the company has more than 60,000 employees across 60 countries.
自联想在2005年收购IBM的个人电脑业务以来，这家中国公司高调进行了一系列的收购。作为全球最大的个人电脑厂商，联想上周四宣布，公司已从谷歌（Google）手中完成了对摩托罗拉（Motorola）移动业务的收购，交易金额高达29.1亿美元。本次并购使联想成为全球第三大智能手机厂商。每当联想完成一笔跨国收购之后，公司员工就变得更加多元，企业架构也更为复杂。目前，联想拥有超过60,000名员工，分布在60多个国家。
That’s where Conyers comes in. After a slew of culture problems and missed business opportunities shortly after Lenovo acquired part of IBM, the company realized it needed to take a harder look at its strategy for combining new teams. Now serving as Lenovo’s first-ever diversity officer, Conyers’s job is to figure out how to align the company behind common goals while respecting everyone’s differences.
这就是联想请康耶丝来的目的。在收购IBM的PC业务之后不久，联想遭遇了各种企业文化方面的问题，也丧失了不少商业机会。公司意识到，必须更为重视企业并购后的人员整合问题。作为联想第一任首席多元化官，康耶丝的工作是在尊重个人文化背景差异的情况下整合企业文化，从而达到公司的整体目标。
But before Conyers could worry about bringing the company together, she needed to understand Chinese culture for herself. She decided to live and work out of Lenovo’s headquarters in China from 2009 to 2012 and she turned to Gina Qiao, Lenovo’s SVP of Human Resources, to guide her through the transition. Qiao, who works out of Beijing, made a similar decision in 2005 when she lived and worked out of Lenovo’s Raleigh, North Carolina offices. Qiao also struggled to understand American workplace culture. She didn’t realize that when she didn’t speak up constantly in meetings, her American coworkers assumed she hadn’t prepared.
要将公司凝聚为一体，康耶丝自己首先得理解中国文化。从2009到2012年，她决定来联想中国总部北京工作和生活，并求教于联想人力资源高级副总裁乔健，来帮助她适应文化上的过渡。乔健目前在北京工作，但是2005年时她也做出过类似的决定——到联想美国总部北卡州罗利工作和生活。在适应美国公司文化的过程中，乔健也遭遇过不少困难。比如，她当时并不知道，如果她在会议上不经常主动发言，她的美国同事就会以为她没做准备。
The two women relied on each other to understand the nuances of corporate behavior across the organization and encouraged their co-workers to do the same.
两位女性互为依赖，以理解整个组织内的企业行为折射的细微差异，同时鼓励其他同事们也这么做。
“You need to take the time to listen more and take time to get to know people’s struggles and their relationships,” said Conyers. “I needed to take the time to go live in that environment and now I am such a better global leader as a result.”
“你需要花时间去倾听，花时间去了解人们所处的困境以及他们的关系，”康耶丝总结说。“我需要花时间去生活在这个环境里面。和过去相比，现在我是一个更称职的全球性领导者。”
Conyers and Qiao outline both their personal journeys along side Lenovo’s path to becoming a truly global company in the recently released book The Lenovo Way. The book outlines the tech giant’s initial struggles with corporate culture clashes and traces how Lenovo successfully became the largest company in the world in global computer sales. For Conyers and Qiao, figuring out how to bring people together with each new acquisition is just as essential as mixing supply chains and distributions networks. Without a concrete plan of the human side of things, mergers and acquisitions too often fail, they told Fortune.
在最近发布的《联想之道》（The Lenovo Way）一书中，康耶丝和乔健分享了自身的经历，同时也介绍了联想发展成为一家真正的全球性企业前所走过的道路。该书概括了这一技术巨头最初在面临企业文化冲撞时所遭遇的困境，并记录了联想如何成功跻身成为全球最大的国际计算机销售巨擘。对于康耶丝和乔健来说，在一次又一次新的并购中找出凝聚不同员工的方法，与整合供应链和分销网络同样重要。她们在采访中表示，如果没有相应的人力资源方面的具体计划配合，并购的努力往往会付诸东流。
According to the Lenovo execs, here are three key components companies should consider when acquiring a company from a different part of the world:
据联想两位高管的介绍，在收购一家外国公司时，需要考虑以下三个基本点：
1. Live diversity every day. In 2009, Lenovo realized that the new leadership team, comprised of executives drawn primarily from Lenovo, IBM and Dell, was not fully committed to bringing Lenovo’s operations together into one fully integrated business. “There was this terminology of three rivers” as each created silos between themselves, said Conyers. It was only once the company realized that cultural integration shouldn’t be rushed and needs to be something constantly considered did workers feel like they were truly apart of one global firm.
1.真正融入多样性。2009年，联想发现由联想、IBM和戴尔（Dell）前高管组成的新领导团队，并没有完全意识到需要把公司融汇成一个整体来经营。康耶丝说，当时每个人都有自己的一套做事方法，结果变成了“三套体系，各自为政”。只有当公司意识到文化融合不应被压抑而应被重视时，员工才会真正感受到他们是一家国际化企业的一份子。
2. Have a zero-mindset. Too often, employees who come into a new company after a merger think that the success they had in the past can be replicated in the future with their new firm. Understanding that you often need to start from square one when outlining corporate strategies is essential to success.
2.抱着一切归零的心态。并购后进入新公司的员工往往想当然，以为自己可以在新公司复制以往的成功经验。在规划公司战略时，工作往往需要从头开始，员工对这一点的充分理解是成功的必要条件。
3. Have humility. Humility is the basis of any meaningful interaction between two people trying to understand each other’s culture. “When you have humility, you are humble and you are open to new ideas. That’s essential at any global company,” says Conyers.
3.谦逊。谦逊是人和人之间尝试了解双方文化的基础。“当一个人保持谦逊时，就会虚心接受新的观点。这在任何一家国际化企业里都是必不可少的，”康耶丝说。
An essential part of IBM’s IBM -0.09% campaign to conquer cloud computing is a new product called BlueMix. Launched in February of this year, the platform offers developers tools to create and run new apps for business. Unusually for a project of its size, it came together fast. A team of IBMers took only about 18 months to build BlueMix from initial concept, through technical underpinnings and design, to beta testing and marketing.
今年2月，科技巨头IBM公司发布了BlueMix云平台，作为其征战云计算领域的杀手锏。这一平台向开发者提供了多种工具，为企业创建和运行新的应用。对于一个如此大型的项目来说，其完成速度之快简直异乎寻常。从初步构思、技术攻坚和设计，再到测试和展开营销，这一系列流程IBM团队仅仅用了18个月就完成了。
Phil Gilbert, Big Blue’s general manager of design, who led the BlueMix project, thinks it’s no coincidence that the dozens of engineers, developers, and designers who worked on it are scattered all over the world and have rarely, if ever, sat down with each other at the same time and place. “You get much more diversity of thought with virtual teams,” Gilbert says. “A well-run virtual team comes up with, not just more ideas, but better ones, and faster.”
此次BlueMix项目的带头人、IBM设计部的总经理菲尔o吉尔伯特认为，这样的高效率并非巧合。负责该项目的数十位工程师、开发人员和设计师分散在世界各地，他们甚至从来没有在现实生活中碰过面。“虚拟团队带来了思维的多样性。”吉尔伯特说，“一个运作良好的虚拟团队不仅可以获得更多创意，而且他们的创意往往更加出色和高效。”
It seems BlueMix was no fluke. Adam Kingl, executive director of learning solutions at London Business School, has studied teams and consulted with managers at more than 120 companies, across a range of industries, from pharmaceuticals to retailing to banking. “When it comes to innovation or solving complex problems, virtual teams often get better and faster results,” he says. “And that is true whether you’re looking at teams in different office locations around the world, or teams that simply have some members telecommuting from home.”
BlueMix的成功似乎并非侥幸。亚当o金格是伦敦商学院（London Business School）学习解决方案课程执行主任，他对制药、零售和银行业等120多家企业的团队进行过相关研究，还咨询过他们的管理者。“在创新和解决复杂的问题方面，虚拟团队的效果更好、速度更快。”他介绍说，“无论这些团队成员是来自公司的各海外办事处，还是在家通过网络远程办公，他们都有着同样出色的表现。”
The key, Kingl says, is to brainstorm using the BlueMix approach, a technique some companies call an “idea jam.” Instead of a teleconference or conference call that brings everyone together (no matter what time zone they may be in), an idea jam poses a question or describes a problem and then gives the whole team a chance to weigh in online, typically over a 48-hour period, via a message board or chat room.
金格说，关键在于要运用BlueMix的方法进行头脑风暴。有些企业也把BlueMix的这种方法称为“创意脑力激荡（idea jam）”。这种方法并没有采用传统方式，通过远程会议或电话会议把所有团队成员召集在一起（无论成员身在哪个时区），而是提出或者阐述一个问题，让成员在一定时间范围内思考并发言（一般是48小时），采用的形式是留言板或者聊天室。
Letting people make comments and suggestions on their own schedule contributes to “a meritocracy of ideas” in a couple of ways, says Kingl. First, the group dynamics are different. Whether in person or online all at the same time, team members “often agree with a dominant person—either the most senior, or simply the loudest or most persuasive—to keep the peace,” Kingl observes.
金格表示，让人们按照自己的时间安排发表意见和评论，可以在很多方面产生“非凡的创意回响”。首先，这种情况下团队会更有活力。根据金格的观察，无论是办公室会议还是同时在线讨论，团队成员们“往往会赞同某个主导者的意见来维持一团和气——这个人可能是最资深的，或者仅仅是嗓门最大的，又或者是发言最具说服力的。”
By contrast, opening up a forum for discussion where people weigh in one by one “prompts the participants to evaluate ideas based on their merit, rather than deferring to one team member,” he says. Phil Gilbert agrees. People who might otherwise hesitate to disagree with a colleague directly—even if they have a better idea—are bolder in an asynchronous, idea-jam-type setting. “It’s not confrontational, more just contributing a different opinion,” he says.
而开辟一个论坛让人们逐个参与讨论，“可以促使参与者根据各个创意的优点进行客观评估，而不是盲目听从某一位成员”。菲尔o吉尔伯特对此深表认同。即便自己创意更好，有些人也不好意思直接反对某个同事，而在匿名创意脑力激荡的环境下，这类人会变得更加勇于发表意见。金格认为，“这并不是和别人对着干，而是贡献不同的意见。”
That’s especially true for teams with members who are introverts, notes Kingl. “Introverted people often have valuable insights to contribute, but they often take time to formulate their thoughts,” he says. “In traditional meetings, they may not get that.” With a couple of days to speak up, instead of a couple of hours, introverts are more likely to be heard.
金格指出，这一点在那些性格内向的团队成员身上表现得更加明显。“性格内向的人通常会有一些高见，但是他们需要比较多的时间来整理思路。”他说，“在传统的会议中，他们可能无法获得充分的时间来思考。”如果给他们几天时间而不仅仅是几个小时来组织发言，那么性格内向者的发言就会更显分量，容易引起大家的注意。
When team members are all together in one place or at one time, the result is sometimes “a tendency toward groupthink,” Gilbert adds. Since BlueMix is a global platform, he says, “we very deliberately put the team on every continent, in Canada, India, Brazil, England, and so on. So even when the whole group came together online, what had happened in between was very different because the locations and cultures were so different.” That approach breeds innovation, he says, by eliciting “not just diverse ideas, but independently developed ideas,” he says. “It can lead to great outcomes.”
吉尔伯特补充说，当所有的团队成员全部集中在某个地方或者同时集中讨论，有时候“会出现集体趋同思考的倾向”。他说，因为BlueMix是一个全球性的平台，“我们故意让团队成员来自不同的洲，比如加拿大、印度、巴西和英格兰等等。所以，即便整个团队同时上线，他们的不同地理位置和文化背景也会带来很多不一样的想法。”他表示，这种方法有助于孕育创新，“不仅仅是激发多样化的创意，而且可以让这些创意独立形成，”吉尔伯特说，“最后往往会产生令人惊艳的结果。”
Airbnb has formed a partnership with China Broadband Capital and Sequoia China to help the apartment-sharing app expand into the Chinese market.
Airbnb已与中国宽带产业基金(China Broadband Capital)及红杉中国(Sequoia China)建立合作关系，以帮助这一公寓分享应用向中国市场扩张。
The San Francisco-based ‘sharing economy’ app will be advised by local venture capitalists on how to adapt to sell to Chinese travellers. One of its first tasks will be to recruit a chief executive for Airbnb China.
中国当地的风险投资家将向这家总部位于旧金山的“分享经济”应用公司提供咨询，告诉它如何调整自身、以适应中国旅游市场。该公司的首要任务之一，将是为Airbnb中国(Airbnb China)招募一名首席执行官。
The partnership comes amid a $1.5bn fundraising round from investors including Beijing-based Hillhouse Capital and investment firm Tiger Global, and led by US private equity firm General Atlantic. The round, which boosts the company’s valuation to at least $24bn, will be used to try to tap into booming demand in Asia.
与此同时，Airbnb正向投资者展开一轮规模为15亿美元的募资。这些投资者以美国私人股本公司泛大西洋投资集团(General Atlantic)为首，还包括总部位于北京的高瓴资本(Hillhouse Capital)以及投资机构老虎环球基金(Tiger Global)。这轮募资将把Airbnb的估值推升到至少240亿美元，所筹资金将用于努力从亚洲急剧增长的需求中获利。
Airbnb has seen strong growth in South Korea and Singapore and is looking to invest more across the region, according to someone familiar with the plans. Airbnb would not confirm that the new partners were also investing in the company.
了解相关计划的人士称，Airbnb在韩国和新加坡都实现强劲增长，目前正寻求在亚洲各地展开更多投资。至于新的合作伙伴是否也在投资Airbnb，该公司不愿予以证实。
Brian Chesky, co-founder and chief executive of Airbnb, said the number of Chinese guests staying in Airbnb properties around the world increased by 700 per cent last year, growing faster than the number of guests from any other single nationality.
Airbnb联合创始人、首席执行官布赖恩切斯基(Brian Chesky)表示，去年，在世界各地Airbnb房屋居住过的中国房客的人数增加了7倍，比其他任何一个国家房客人数的增长都快。
“When we see this growth and hear the stories from our community, it is clear that Airbnb is uniquely positioned to connect Chinese guests to amazing travel experiences,” he said in a blogpost.
他在一篇博文中表示：“当我们看到这样的增长、听到我们圈子内的种种故事时，我们明白了一点：在让中国客人享受到绝佳旅游体验方面，Airbnb拥有独特的优势。
“And as we move into our next phase of expansion in China, we know we will need deep local knowledge and expertise to keep this momentum going.”
“在我们的在华扩张进入新阶段之际，我们知道，我们需要找到对当地情况和业务有深入了解的人，以确保这一扩张势头能够持续下去。”
HONG KONG — For large Internet companies in the United States, the prevailing wisdom has long been that China is off limits.
香港——对于美国的大型互联网公司而言，“中国是禁区”是一个长期而普遍的共识。
Beijing’s concerns about being unable to control foreign sites, combined with regulations that require companies to censor and monitor users, has led many start-ups to heed the experience of forebears like Twitter and Facebook and refrain from opening a local China site.
北京对无法控制外国网站感到担心，再加上一些规定要求公司对用户进行审查和监控，很多初创企业因此吸取了Twitter和Facebook等前辈的教训，不在中国本土开设网站。
But that may be changing.
但这种情况可能会改变。
With its announcement on Tuesday that it was expanding in China, Airbnb joined a growing list of large American Internet companies that have begun experimenting with new models to enter the Chinese market. With more than 600 million Internet users, China is a rich prize.
越来越多美国大型互联网公司正在尝试采用新的模式，进军中国市场，现在Airbnb也加入了这个行列；本周二，Airbnb宣布将在中国扩张业务。中国拥有逾6亿互联网用户，是一个富有的矿藏。
In a statement on its blog, Airbnb said outbound bookings from Chinese tourists had risen 700 percent during the past year, making it the company’s fastest-growing market of customers booking stays outside their home country. Airbnb, a start-up based in San Francisco, allows people to offer their homes for rent; it completed a fundraising round in June of more than $1 billion.
Airbnb在其博客上发表声明，说在过去一年，中国游客境外订房服务飙升了700%，成为该公司“境外订房”领域增长最快的市场。Airbnb是一家总部设在旧金山的初创公司，用户可以用它出租自家的住所；在今年6月的一轮融资中，该公司筹集了逾10亿美元资金。
Airbnb offered few details of how it would meet that Chinese demand. But the company said it wanted to “create a truly localized platform” while being “prudent” in establishing operations within China. To help, the company said it would work with the Chinese venture capital firms China Broadband Capital and Sequoia China, the local affiliate of the American firm, to increase its presence in the country.
对于Airbnb将如何达到中国的要求，该公司没有提供具体细节，但它表示希望“建立一个真正的本地化平台”，并在中国境内“谨慎”经营。为了做到这一点，Airbnb表示，它将与中国风险投资公司中国宽带产业基金和美国红杉资本在中国的子公司红杉中国(Sequoia China)合作，在中国扩大业务。
The first move for the venture capital firms will be to help recruit a chief executive for Airbnb’s operations in China before expanding the local team.
风投公司的第一个行动，就在是帮助该公司扩充本地团队之前，招募一名首席执行官来负责Airbnb在中国的业务。
The strategy closely resembles one taken by the professional social network LinkedIn, which worked with the same two venture capital firms when it introduced a local site in early 2014. LinkedIn also hired a separate chief executive for its China operations.
这非常类似于职业社交网络领英(LinkedIn)曾经采取的战略。LinkedIn在2014年初推出中国本地的站点时，也与这两家风险投资公司进行了合作。LinkedIn也单独聘请了一位首席执行官来负责中国区的业务。
LinkedIn’s strategy was to have its partners help the company work with the Chinese government. In particular, China Broadband Capital is politically well connected. Founded by Edward Tian, an entrepreneur who once ran a telecommunications company with the son of the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin, China Broadband has assisted other American businesses, like Evernote, in entering China.
LinkedIn的策略是让合作伙伴来帮助该公司和中国政府打交道。中国宽带产业基金尤其拥有良好的政治人脉。该公司曾协助印象笔记(Evernote)等其他美国企业进入中国，其创始人田溯宁曾与中国前国家主席江泽民的儿子共同经营一家电信公司。
In an interview last year, a company spokesman said China Broadband saw its role in the LinkedIn deal as helping the American company communicate with the government.
该公司发言人在去年的一次采访中表示，在LinkedIn的交易中，该公司认为自己的作用是帮助美国公司与政府沟通。
Although it is unclear what demands Airbnb might face, proposed Chinese laws dictate the company must store Chinese customer data inside China. That could mean giving the government access to data not just about the domestic travels of Chinese, but also about where they stay abroad.
虽然目前还不清楚Airbnb可能会面临哪些要求，但中国正在拟议的一些法律规定，各公司拥有的中国用户数据必须保存在中国境内。这可能意味着政府不仅可以获得中国人在国内旅行的数据，还能获得他们在国外旅游的数据。
But cracking the Chinese market must happen first. Brian Chesky, the chief executive and a co-founder of Airbnb, wrote in the blog post that Chinese tourists have been the top spenders internationally since 2012. Expanding inside China will allow the company to make money on their domestic travels as well.
但首先要做的是打入中国市场。Airbnb联合创始人兼首席执行官布莱恩·切斯基(Brian Chesky)在博客中写道，从2012年起，中国游客已经跻身于国际旅游的主要消费群。Airbnb在中国境内扩张，可以从中国的国内旅游市场中赚到钱。
To do so, Airbnb will run up against a local analogue, Tujia, which is already valued at more than $1 billion and offers access to hundreds of thousands of properties across China. Like Airbnb, Tujia helps people market homes to tourists for short-term stays, but it also provides an array of other services around the rental, like cleaning and managing properties.
要做到这一点，Airbnb将与中国本土品牌途家开展竞争。途家的估值已逾10亿美元，其网站上提供了数以十万计的中国住所。像在Airbnb上一样，用户也可以在途家上把住所出租给游客短期居住，但途家还提供一系列和租房相关的服务，比如打扫和管理物业等。
It is unclear whether Airbnb will take up similar services to persuade Chinese to open their doors to visitors. They have an experienced adviser in the industry in the form of Sequoia China’s founder, Neil Shen, who is known in China for starting the Chinese travel site Ctrip.com.
目前尚不清楚Airbnb是否会采用类似服务，说服中国人向游客敞开大门。他们有一名经验丰富的行业顾问——红杉资本中国基金创始人沈南鹏，他在中国因为创建旅游网站携程网(Ctrip.com)而闻名。
In his blog post, Mr. Chesky said Mr. Shen “has deep experience in the Chinese Internet and hospitality sectors.”
切斯基在博客文章中称，沈南鹏“在中国网络及服务领域拥有丰富经验”。
Even as LinkedIn and Uber have led the way for Airbnb, neither has managed to avoid causing a stir. Some LinkedIn users complained online that the company had failed to communicate how and why it was censoring content for users in China. It also briefly censored posts in Hong Kong, which enjoys freedom from Beijing’s content restrictions.
先行一步的领英和优步(Uber)没能避免引发不满。领英的一些用户在网上抱怨称，该公司没有表明他们如何及为什么审查中国用户的内容。该公司还一度对香港的内容加以审查，而那里是无需接受北京的内容管制的。
And several Uber offices have been raided in recent months by local Chinese police and regulators who say the company’s service is illegal. Uber drivers and taxi drivers alike have protested in different cities. Uber is also working to ensure that more of the data from its China operations are stored within the country, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
近几个月来，优步的几个办公室遭到当地警方及监管机构的突查，他们称该公司提供非法服务。一些城市的优步司机和出租车司机进行了抗议。据一名知情人士透露，优步还在努力确保更多中国业务的数据储存在中国。
All three companies are likely aware of the potential political fallout that could come if they change their minds. Google, which once acceded to China’s demands to censor content, noisily reversed course in 2010, delivering uncensored results to Chinese users from servers in Hong Kong.
这三家公司可能都认识到，如果它们改变主意，可能会带来政治后果。谷歌(Google)曾同意中国提出的内容审查要求，但在2010年高调地逆转路线，通过在香港的服务器为中国用户提供不受审查的搜索结果。
That soured the company’s relationship with the Chinese authorities, and Google products are blocked in China.
此举致使该公司与中国当局的关系恶化，谷歌产品在中国被封。
Airbnb has opened its site to Cuba, making it one of the first US companies to open shop on the island since the dramatic thaw in tensions between Washington and Havana last year.
空中食宿(Airbnb)向古巴开放了它的网站，成为自美国与古巴两国关系解冻以来，首家在古巴展开业务的美国企业之一。
After five decades of hostility, estrangement, and economic sanctions between the two countries, tourism to Cuba — historically dominated by Canadians and Europeans — is set to spike after President Barack Obama loosened travel restrictions in January.
在两国间经历了50年的敌对、疏远和经济制裁之后，今年1月，美国总统巴拉克?奥巴马(Barack Obama)放宽了对美国人赴古巴的旅游限制。这一措施的出台，会令古巴的外国游客出现激增。传统上去到古巴的游客以加拿大人和欧洲人为主。
Airbnb expects “significant demand” for Cuban rentals from Americans. US user searches for Cuba on Airbnb’s site have jumped 70 per cent since January, the company said.
空中食宿预计，美国人在古巴租房的需求将是巨大的。自1月以来，美国用户在其网站搜索古巴的次数已跃升了70%。
The online house-rental start-up now allows licensed American travellers to book rooms at more than 1,000 listings across Cuba, many featuring ornate colonial design and cheap prices: the average rental in Havana costs $42 per night.
目前，通过这家在线租房初创企业，得到许可的美国游客能预定遍布古巴的逾1000间房舍的房间。其中许多房间不仅拥有华丽的殖民时代设计，价格也十分低廉：哈瓦那的平均租金为每晚42美元。
“For over 50 years, Cuba has been out of reach for most Americans” said Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb’s co-founder. “When we founded Airbnb?.?.?.?our dream was to help create a world where you could belong anywhere?.?.?.”
空中食宿共同创始人内森?布莱沙奇克(Nathan Blecharczyk)表示：“在超过50年的时间里，古巴对多数美国人来说一直可望而不可及。在创建空中食宿时……我们的梦想就是帮助人们打造一个处处是我家的世界……”
Airbnb’s “sharing economy” business model makes Cuba a potential sweet spot. It does not face some of the roadblocks for traditional American hotels, who would have to buy property and hire employees to operate on the island.
对于空中食宿的“分享经济”业务模式来说，古巴或将是一个绝佳的运营环境。这一模式可以避开传统美国酒店营运商去古巴开展业务会遭遇到的障碍，包括需要买地，还需要聘用员工。
Rather, the $13bn company has soared in popularity as the middleman for people who want to rent out a spare room in their home.
相比之下，市值130亿美元的空中食宿在古巴的人气已急剧上升，那些想要出租家中多余房间的人们将它视作中间人。
Still, limited internet and phone access in Cuba poses a problem for Airbnb, whose booking system operates entirely online. Only five per cent of Cubans have home access to the internet and less than a fifth have mobile phones, according to US officials.
不过，古巴上网和打电话的条件都十分有限，这对整个预订系统都在网上的空中食宿是个大问题。美国官方数据显示，可在家中上网的古巴人只占5%，而拥有移动电话的则不到五分之一。
To enter this unplugged community, Airbnb has tapped into a local network of private home-stays — casas particulares — who have dominated the Cuban tourism industry for decades and make up a sizeable income for locals in an otherwise isolated, sluggish economy.
此外，由于古巴经济开放的节奏十分缓慢，外国企业仍受制于当地监管规定及美国的制裁举措。官方统计的数字显示，自东欧剧变以来，在古巴设立的外国企业中，六成已关门大吉。
Airbnb is in talks to buy China’s second-largest home accommodation service, according to a person close to the discussions, as the Silicon Valley company deepens its push into China.
据一名知情人士透露，Airbnb正在谈判收购中国第二大民宿短租服务提供商。目前这家硅谷企业正在深化进入中国市场的努力。
The acquisition of Xiaozhu, if agreed, is poised to be the home-sharing service’s largest deal to date, with the Chinese company last valued at $300m. It comes on the heels of Airbnb’s expansion last week into new travel services such as tours.
收购小猪的交易若能达成，将成为民宿短租服务领域迄今最大的交易，因为这家中国公司上一次估值达到3亿美元。上周Airbnb刚刚推出新的旅行相关服务，包括旅游在内。
As the world’s biggest outbound tourist market, China has been a focus for Airbnb, and the company has said it will double its investment there next year.
作为世界上最大的出境旅游市场，中国一直是Airbnb的一个重点，该公司表示，明年它在中国的投资将翻一番。
In addition to having about 75,000 home listings in China, Airbnb’s strategy so far has been heavily focused on outbound tourists who visit cities in Europe, the US or other parts of Asia.
除了在中国有大约7.5万间房源外，Airbnb迄今的战略主要以访问欧洲、美国或亚洲其他地区的城市的出境游客为目标。
For Xiaozhu, a deal with Airbnb could help boost its position at a time when China’s home accommodation market, once consisting of half a dozen Airbnb clones, has been rapidly consolidating.
对小猪来说，与Airbnb达成交易可能有助于提高其地位；中国的民宿短租市场一度有六家Airbnb效仿者，近来则在快速整合。
The largest company in the market, Tujia, recently bought Chinese travel services provider Ctrip’s vacation rental business, and acquired Mighty Talent, another holiday rental company, through a share swap. Tujia has more than 400,000 listings in China and has raised more than $400m from investors.
该市场的最大公司途家(Tujia)最近收购了中国旅游服务提供商携程(Ctrip)的度假短租业务，并通过股份互换方式收购了蚂蚁短租。途家在中国有超过40万间房源，并已从投资者募集逾4亿美元。
Xiaozhu, which just raised $65m from investors earlier this month in its fifth major fundraising drive, has more than 100,000 listings and close to 10m users. Its backers include Legend Capital, Joy Capital, and Bertelsmann Asia Investment Fund. A fundraising round last year valued the company at $300m.
小猪在本月早些时候刚刚进行了第五轮重大募资，募集了6500万美元。该公司拥有超过10万间房源和近1000万用户。其支持者包括联想投资(Legend Capital)、愉悦资本(Joy Capital)和贝塔斯曼亚洲投资基金(Bertelsmann Asia Investment Fund)。去年的一轮募资对该公司估值3亿美元。
While Airbnb has worked hard to accommodate outbound Chinese travellers — such as by integrating Unionpay and Alipay for payments — a deal with Xiaozhu could help it gain more domestic inventory in China. Acquiring a homegrown champion could also help smooth future regulatory challenges.
虽然Airbnb已经努力为中国出境游客提供服务——例如接受银联(Unionpay)和支付宝(Alipay)付款，但与小猪签订协议可以帮助其在中国获得更多房源。收购一家本土冠军企业也可能有助于化解未来的监管挑战。
Many prominent tech companies have failed to make it in the Chinese market, either because they deemed the discount-based competition to be too brutal, or due to censorship issues. Earlier this year, Uber sold its entire China business to rival Didi Chuxing, in exchange for a stake in its Chinese rival.
许多知名科技公司未能在中国市场打开局面，要么是因为它们认为基于折扣的竞争过于残酷，要么是因为审查问题。今年早些时候，优步(Uber)将整个中国业务出售给了竞争对手滴滴出行(Didi Chuxing)，换取了后者的一部分股份。
Airbnb declined to comment on whether the companies were in talks over a deal, which was first reported by the Bloomberg News agency. Xiaozhu could not be reached for comment.
Airbnb拒绝评论两家公司是否在洽谈交易，这条消息最初是由彭博新闻社(Bloomberg News)报道的。记者联系不上小猪请其置评。
Airbnb's rules allow cameras outdoors and in living rooms and common areas, but never in bathrooms or anywhere guests plan to sleep, including rooms with foldout beds.
Airbnb的规则是，允许在室外、客厅以及公用区域安装摄像机，但决不可以安装在浴室或任何房客打算睡觉的区域（包括有折叠床的房间）。
Starting in early 2018, Airbnb added another layer of disclosure: If hosts indicate they have cameras anywhere on their property, guests receive a pop-up informing them where the cameras are located and where they are aimed.
2018年早些时候，Airbnb增加了一层公开规则：如果房东表明他们的房产中安装有摄像机，房客们将收到提示，告知他们摄像机的位置以及意图拍摄的位置。
To book the property, the guests must click “agree,” indicating that they're aware of the cameras and consent to being filmed.
在预定民宿前，房客们必须点击“同意”，表明他们已对摄像机知情，并且愿意被拍摄。
Of course, hosts have plenty of reason to train cameras on the homes they rent out to strangers. They can catch guests who attempt to steal, or who trash the place, or who initially say they're traveling alone, then show up to a property with five people.
当然了，房东们也有许多理由需要在租给陌生人的房子里安装摄像机。这样可以揪出试图偷窃或者毁损房屋的客人，或者那些一开始声称独自的，转身却打包了五个同伴一起来住的人。
A representative for Airbnb's Trust & Safety communications department told me the company tries to filter out hosts who may attempt to surveil guests by matching them against sex-offender and felony databases.
Airbnb的信托及安全通讯处一位代表告诉我，公司通过比对性犯罪者及犯重罪者数据库，试图过滤掉或将监视客人的房主。
The home-rental start-up says it's cracking down on hosts who record guests. But is it doing enough?
这家租房新公司表示，对于偷拍客人的房主将予以严厉制裁。但是它做得够不够呢？
In a statement, an Airbnb representative said, “The safety of our community—both online and offline—is our priority, which is why we take reports of privacy violations very seriously and employ sophisticated technologies to help prevent bad actors from using our platform in the first place.”
在一份声明中，一名Airbnb代表说到：“社区的安全性——线上及线下——是我们的优先考虑项。因此，我们从一开始便及其严肃地对待侵犯隐私的报告、使用尖端技术，来防止坏的参与者使用我们的平台。”
But four guests who found cameras in their rentals told The Atlantic the company has inconsistently applied its own rules when investigating their claims, providing them with incorrect information and making recommendations that they say risked putting them in harm's way.
但是在租借房屋中发现偷拍摄像机的四位房客，这样告知《大西洋月刊》——在调查他们的诉求时，提供给他们错误的信息，给出的建议或将致他们于不利境地——该公司未能一致地践行自己的规则。
Earlier this month, I spent a night tossing and turning, overwhelmed by an enchanting 13th-century stone house on the edge of Civita di Bagnoregio, a deserted hilltop town about 75 miles north of Rome. I booked it on Airbnb.
本月初，我在意大利白露里治奥古城边缘的一座石屋里住了一晚，这座充满魅力的石屋建于13世纪，我由于太过激动，整晚辗转反侧，难以入眠。白露里治奥古城坐落于山顶，是一座废弃的小城，距离罗马以北约75英里。我是在Airbnb上订到这间民宿的。
“Casa d’Artista,” or Artist’s House, is the first municipal building to be listed on the lodging site. The host for our stay was Civita’s mayor, Francesco Bigiotti.
“艺术家之家”是Airbnb网站上挂出的首家市政房。接待我们的主人是当地市长佛郎西斯科·比亚焦蒂。
Airbnb worked with Bigiotti’s office to revive the abandoned public building, which was heavily damaged in an earthquake in the 1980s.
Airbnb与市长办公室展开合作，致力于恢复在上世纪八十年代的一次地震中因受到严重破坏而遭遗弃的公共建筑。
Airbnb has announced a raft of policies to fight discrimination at the home-sharing platform, after user complaints and academic studies found bias against non-white users.
在用户投诉以及学术研究发现非白人用户遭遇偏见后，Airbnb宣布了一系列政策来解决这个居所共享平台的歧视问题。
The issue of discrimination is one that cuts to the quick at many Silicon Valley tech companies, where most start-up founders and executives are white men.
歧视问题戳到了很多硅谷科技公司的痛处，多数初创公司的创始人和高管都是白人男性。
Airbnb’s new policies include increasing the number of instant book rooms (which are less prone to discrimination), establishing a team of engineers to fight bias, and asking all Airbnb users to sign an anti-discrimination agreement.
Airbnb的新政策包括增加即刻预定房间（不容易出现歧视），组建一个工程师团队来对抗偏见，同时要求Airbnb所有用户签订一份反歧视协议。
The online room-letting service is also experimenting with reducing the prominence of profile photos for guests, to reduce discrimination by hosts.
这个在线房间出租服务还在尝试降低租客档案照片的重要性，以减少房东的歧视。
A report that Airbnb commissioned from Laura Murphy, a former official at the American Civil Liberties Union, found that part of the reason the company was slow to address discrimination concerns was the company’s employees are not sufficiently diverse.
Airbnb委托美国公民自由联盟(American Civil Liberties Union)前官员劳拉?墨菲(Laura Murphy)所作的报告发现，该公司解决歧视问题进程缓慢的部分原因是该公司员工不够多元化。
In response, Airbnb has pledged to increase its ratio of minority employees, from 9.6 per cent today to 11 per cent by the end of 2017, and to increase its procurement from minority suppliers.
作为回应，Airbnb承诺提高少数族裔员工的比例，从当前的9.6%提高至2017年底的11%，并且增加从少数族裔供应商采购。
The company is also working with community-based organisations to encourage more minorities to act as Airbnb hosts.
该公司还与社区组织合作，鼓励更多少数族裔成为Airbnb的房东。
Airbnb, which has shaken up the global hospitality industry, is one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent private tech companies, but in recent months it has become a lightning rod for discussions about diversity in the industry.
撼动了全球酒店行业的Airbnb，是硅谷最著名的私有科技公司之一，但是最近几个月它在业内引发了围绕多元化的讨论。
Last December a Harvard University study found Airbnb travellers with black-sounding names were less likely to book a room, and this year several Airbnb users complained of discrimination from hosts.
去年12月，哈佛大学(Harvard University)的一份研究显示，Airbnb上名字听起来像黑人的旅客不太可能租到房屋，今年一些Airbnb用户投诉受到了房东的歧视。
In her report, Ms Murphy said Airbnb’s own research had confirmed that minorities struggle more than others to book a listing.
墨菲在报告中称，Airbnb自己的研究证实少数族裔比其他人更难订到房间。
Since those complaints emerged Brian Chesky, chief executive, has been frank about Airbnb’s shortcomingsin dealing with discrimination.
自从接到投诉后，Airbnb首席执行官布赖恩?切斯基(Brian Chesky)对公司在处理歧视时的缺陷毫无隐瞒。
We have been slow to address these problems, and for this I am sorry, he said in an email sent to all Airbnb users yesterday. I take responsibility for any pain or frustration this has caused members of our community.
我们在解决这些问题时进程缓慢，我对此表示抱歉，他在昨天发送给Airbnb所有用户的电子邮件中表示，我对这给我们社区成员造成的任何痛苦或失望负责。
The company’s plans also include mandatory anti-bias training for all employees, as well as an Open Doors policy that will provide special assistance for any guest who experiences -discrimination.
该公司的计划还包括对所有员工强制进行反偏见培训，并推出了一项开门政策，为经历了歧视的房客提供特别协助。
Airbnb faces a fight for its life in the Big Apple as New York governor Andrew Cuomo prepares to sign a bill that would in effect end the home-sharing group’s business in New York City.
Airbnb将在纽约面临一场生死之战，纽约州州长安德鲁.库默(Andrew Cuomo)准备签署一个法案，实质上将结束这家住房分享集团在纽约市的业务。
The San Francisco start-up is waging an eleventh-hour campaign to thwart the legislation, offering to impose a mandatory host registration system to help the state keep track of renters and a “one host, one home” rule to curtail the challenge it poses to New York hoteliers.
这家位于旧金山的初创企业正在进行最后时刻的努力以阻止立法，提出将执行强制性房东登记系统，帮助纽约州追踪租户，并实行“一个居所，一个房东”规则，以减少其对纽约酒店业构成的挑战。
Mr Cuomo must decide whether to sign the bill by the end of next week. If it becomes law, it would impose fines of up to $7,500 on hosts who advertise short-term accommodation through Airbnb.
库默必须最迟在下周结束之前决定是否签署该法案。一旦立法成功，房东若通过Airbnb宣传短期住宿，将受到高达7500美元的罚款。
Linda Rosenthal, the state assemblywoman who co-sponsored the bill, told the Financial Times that Airbnb’s concessions were “absolutely not” enough to address her fears. “The lawbreaker does not get to make the law,” she said.
该法案的共同倡导者、纽约州议员琳达.罗森塔尔(Linda Rosenthal)向英国《金融时报》表示，Airbnb的妥协“绝对不足以”解决她的忧虑。她说：“违法者不能制定法律。”
The online service, which connects owners of homes and flats with tourists and other renters in cities around the world, has often clashed with regulators who accuse the company of facilitating illegal hotel businesses and reducing affordable housing stock.
Airbnb提供的网上租房服务，在全球独立屋和公寓的业主与游客和其他租客之间牵线搭桥，该服务经常与监管者发生冲突，后者指控Airbnb为非法酒店业务提供方便，减少了可负担住宅存量。
In New York, hotel unions and New York City officials have been particularly vociferous about the company’s failure to comply with a 2010 law that banned short-term rentals in Manhattan — but is rarely enforced.
在纽约，酒店工会和纽约市官员的反对尤为激烈，他们指责该公司未能遵守2010年一项禁止在曼哈顿提供短租服务的法律——但很少执行。
Airbnb said yesterday that it wanted to pay taxes in New York, estimating that it could generate about $90m a year for the state under its new registration scheme. The company also proposed a new “three strikes” rule that would permanently ban hosts who break the 2010 law more than three times.
Airbnb昨日表示想在纽约缴税，按照新的房东登记计划，估计这将为纽约州产生每年9000万美元税收。该公司还提出了新的“三振出局”规定，违反2010年法律三次以上的房东将遭到永久性禁止。
The company has already reached similar tax agreements with many other cities. In New York, Airbnb lists 46,000 apartments and homes.
该公司已与其他许多城市达成类似税务协议。在纽约，Airbnb提供4.6万套公寓和住宅。
Like other such Silicon Valley start-ups that have disrupted traditional business models, Airbnb has been forced, often through confrontation, to become more responsive to local regulators and interest groups as it expands.
就像其他破坏了传统商业模式的硅谷创业公司一样，Airbnb在扩张时一直被迫（往往是通过对抗形式）对地方监管者和利益集团做出更多回应。
The company is experimenting with revenue-sharing arrangements that see part of the revenue from Airbnb rentals go back to apartment buildings themselves, and executives said the approach could be expanded in New York.
该公司正尝试收入分成协议，将Airbnb租金中的部分收入返还公寓楼本身，高管表示这种做法可以在纽约推广。
Chris Lehane, Airbnb’s policy chief, called on Mr Cuomo to veto the bill, saying that it represented special interests and hotel-union lobbying.
Airbnb政策主管克里斯.勒汉(Chris Lehane)呼吁库默否决该议案，他表示该议案代表了特殊利益和酒店工会的游说。
Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Leonardo da Vinci ... the art world has never lacked talent. And now, a new painter is ready to join the list, although this one isn’t even human.
莫奈、毕加索、达·芬奇……艺术界从来不缺人才。而如今，一名新画家即将加入这一行列，尽管这位画家甚至并非人类。
Next month, auction house Christie’s Prints and Multiples will make history by offering the first piece of art created by artificial intelligence for sale. The painting is a portrait of a man called Edmond De Belamy, and is expected to be sold for up to $10,000 (69,000 yuan).
佳士得拍卖行的“Prints and Multiples”拍卖活动将于下月创造历史，出售首幅由人工智能（AI）创作的画作。该画作是一位名为爱德蒙·贝拉米的男子的肖像画，估价高达1万美元（约合69000元人民币）。
The work, which features a man with a mysterious look on his face, was created by software developed by the French art group Obvious. Laugero-Lasserre, an art collector from France, called the work “grotesque and amazing at the same time”. This isn’t the first example of AI-produced artwork, as AI has already been used to write poems and compose songs. However, many people doubt whether it should be called art at all.
画中男子的朦胧神态由法国艺术团体Obvious 所开发的软件创作而成。来自法国的艺术收藏家Laugero-Lasserre 称这幅画作“怪诞却又奇妙”。这并非AI创作的首个艺术作品，先前AI已经被用于作诗作曲。然而，不少人都质疑这些作品是否应该被称为艺术。
According to Russian writer Leo Tolstroy (1828-1910), art is about creating emotion. It’s “a means of … joining people together in the same feelings”, he once said.
俄罗斯作家列夫·托尔斯泰认为，艺术在于创造情感，是“一种将拥有相同感受的人们聚集在一起的方式，”他曾如此说道。
So, if the emotion behind art is what makes it, the ability to create and use tools is what makes human beings different from other species. And as a tool itself, the AI technology used to create the portrait is the result of a lot of effort made by several designers. Together, they “fed” the AI a huge collection of paintings from the 14th to the 18th centuries, until it was able to work out how to make similar paintings of its own.
因此，如果是艺术背后的情感创造了艺术，那么创造并使用工具的才能正是人类有别于其他物种之处。而作为一种工具，用于创造这一肖像画的AI技术是多位设计师花费大量努力制造出的成果。他们共同在AI系统中输入了大量14-18世纪的画作，最终令其能够自主画出类似的画作。
The introduction of AI art could be the beginning of a new artistic movement. However, not everyone is ready to welcome these high-tech artists just yet.
AI艺术的引进或许会成为一场全新艺术运动的开端。然而，现在并非所有人都能接受这些高科技艺术家。
“The human mind is what’s behind the AI technology. And the human mind is not a cold, hard fact,” Oscar Schwartz, a professor of AI, said during a TedX Sydney speech. “Rather, it is something that’s created with our opinions and something that changes over time.”
“AI技术的背后是人类的头脑。但人类的头脑并非由冷冰冰的客观事实组成，”AI教授奥斯卡·施瓦辛在一场TedX Sydney的演讲中说道。“而是由我们的观点以及会随着时间流逝而发生变化的事物所组成。”
Festivities were held at the Kremlin fouryears ago to celebrate Kalashnikov's 90th birthday
四年前在克里姆林宫为庆祝卡拉什尼科夫90岁生日举行的庆祝活动
Theinventor of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, Mikhail Kalashnikov, has died aged94, Russian officials say.
俄罗斯官员说，卡拉什尼科夫突击步枪的发明者，米哈伊尔·卡拉什尼科夫已经去世，享年94岁。
The automatic rifle he designed became oneof the world's most familiar and widely used weapons.
他设计的自动步枪，已经成为世界上最熟悉的和广泛使用的武器之一。
Its comparative simplicity made it cheap tomanufacture, as well as reliable and easy to maintain.
其比较简单使它可以被便宜的制造，同时可靠且易于维护。
Although honoured by the state, Kalashnikovmade little money from his gun. He once said he would have been better offdesigning a lawn mower.
虽然由国家表彰，但是卡拉什尼科夫从他的枪那里几乎没有赚到钱。他曾经说过，他会更好地设计一台割草机。
Kalashnikov was admitted to hospital withinternal bleeding in November.
卡拉什尼科夫在十一月由于内出血而被送往医院。
He died on Monday in Izhevsk, Udmurtia,where he lived, an official there said.
周一，他在乌德穆尔特共和国伊热夫斯克的住所中去世，一名官员说。
Matchingthe Germans
与德国匹敌
Mikhail Timofeyevich Kalashnikov was bornon 10 November 1919 in western Siberia, one of 18 children.
米哈伊尔·季莫费耶维奇·卡拉什尼科夫1919年11月10日出生于西西伯利亚，家中18个孩子之一。
卡拉什尼科夫和他的AK47（资料图片）
He was called up by the Red Army in 1938,and his design skills were used to improve the effectiveness of weapons andequipment used by Soviet tank regiments.
1938年，他被征召加入了红军，他的设计技巧被用来提高苏联使用的坦克团武器装备的效能。
He designed the machine gun after beingasked by a fellow soldier why the Russians could not come up with a gun thatwould match the ones used by the Germans.
在他被一个战友问道，为什么俄国人不能设计出一把能与德国人使用的那些相匹敌的枪之后，他设计了这种机关枪。
Work on the AK47 was completed in 1947, andtwo years later the gun was adopted by the Soviet army.
设计AK47工作于1947年完成，并且这种枪在两年后被苏联军队采用。
Kalashnikov continued working into his late80s as chief designer at the Izhevsk firm that first built the AK-47.
卡拉什尼科夫一直工作到80年代末，其间他在伊热夫斯克公司担任首席设计师，这家公司最早生产AK-47。
He received many state honours, includingthe Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour.
他获得了许多国家级荣誉，包括列宁勋章和社会主义劳动英模。
Kalashnikov refused to acceptresponsibility for the many people killed by his weapon, blaming the policiesof other countries that acquired it.
卡拉什尼科夫拒绝接受许多人被他的武器杀死的指责，把这归咎于购买它的其他国家的政策。
However, pride in his invention wastempered with sadness at its use by criminals and child soldiers.
然而，对其发明的自傲，在其发明被罪犯和童军使用时受到了损害，并感到悲伤。
"It is painful for me to see whencriminal elements of all kinds fire from my weapon," Kalashnikov said in2008.
“对我来说这是痛苦的，当我看到各种各样的犯罪分子用我的武器开火的时候，”卡拉什尼科夫在2008年时说。
As pop star misdemeanours go, Minami Minegishi's was tame in the extreme – breaking her group's strict dating ban to spend a night with her boyfriend.
随着流行歌星不当行为曝光，峰岸南极度自责——打破她所在团体的禁爱令，与男友共度一夜。
Yet hours after a magazine published photographs of her leaving his home last month, Minegishi, a member of the wildly popular girl band AKB48, went on to YouTube to issue a tearful apology.
然而在一份杂志公布上个月她离开他家的照片的几小时后，峰岸南，AKB48组合的人气成员，紧接着在YouTube发布含泪道歉的视频。
"As a senior member of the group, it is my responsibility to be a role model for younger members," she said, before ending the four-minute mea culpa with a deep, lingering bow.
“作为该组合的元老成员，成为后辈的道德楷模是我的责任，”在结束4分钟认错以及深深鞠躬之前她说道。
The most striking thing about her apology, however, was her appearance. She had shaved her head, a traditional act of contrition inJapan, but perhaps a step too far for a 20-year-old woman whose "crime" was to have found herself a boyfriend – 19-year-old Alan Shirahama, a dancer in a boyband.
然而，关于她的道歉最令人震惊的事是她的外表。她剃掉她的头发，日本一种传统的忏悔行为，但对一个20岁的女孩也许有点过分，其“罪行”是被发现自己有一个男朋友——19岁的白滨亚岚，一个男生组合里的舞者。
Minegishi explained she had decided to cut off her long hair immediately after seeing her photograph, her face hidden behind a surgical mask and a baseball cap, in the weekly tabloid Shukan Bunshun on Thursday.
峰岸南解释说在看到她的照片之后她立即决定剃光了她的长发，她把脸隐藏在口罩和棒球帽里，在周四的每周小报《文春周刊》里。
Her dramatic gesture underlined the strict rules to which Japan's young pop stars must adhere to project an image of unimpeachable morals.
她戏剧性的姿态强调了日本年轻明星必须坚持其无懈可击的道德楷模形象的严格规定。
In the YouTube video, which has been viewed more than 3m times, Minegishi said the assignation has been "thoughtless and immature".
在YouTube视频上，这已经被浏览超过3百万次，峰岸南说这段约会一直是“轻率和不成熟的”。
"If it is possible, I wish from the bottom of my heart to stay in the band," she said. "Everything I did is entirely my fault. I am so sorry.
“如果有可能，我从心底希望能留在乐队，”她说。“我所做的一切完全是我的错。我很抱歉。”
"I don't believe just doing this means I can be forgiven for what I did, but the first thing I thought was that I don't want to quit AKB48."
“我认为仅仅这样做并不意味着我所做的事可以被原谅，但我首先想到的是我不想离开AKB48。”
AKB48's management agency demoted her to "trainee level" starting on Friday, according to the band's official blog.
AKB48管理机构周五开始降级她的“学员水平”，根据该乐队的官方博客。
Minegishi is among the original members of the band, which since it formed in 2005 has built up a huge following among teenage girls and salarymen who flock to concerts and publicity events for the chance to shake hands with their idols.
峰岸南是乐队的原始成员，从2005年成立起已经在少女和上班族之中形成一个庞大的追随群，他们蜂拥而至音乐会和宣传活动以获得与他们偶像握手的机会。
After software engineering and financial engineering comes linguistic engineering. Google this week raised its market capitalisation by $25bn by shuffling around some executive jobs and changing its name to Alphabet. Who knew that swapping your tiles in a game of corporate Scrabble was worth so much?
搞过了软件工程和金融工程之后，谷歌(Google)又搞起了语言工程。本周谷歌对管理层进行了一些调整，同时将公司名称改成Alphabet，结果市值增加了250亿美元。谁能料到在企业版拼字游戏(Scrabble)中换个名字就能赚这么多呢？
Everyone reads what they want into the new letters. For Larry Page, Google’s restless co-founder, Alphabet means jettisoning the cares of running a corporation and becoming a full-time inventor and venture capitalist, while Sundar Pichai takes the leadership of Google. For employees, it brings the hope of more valuable share options. For Wall Street, it spells clarity.
所有人都从这一新名称中看到了他们想要的。对于求新求变的联合创始人拉里椠奇(Larry Page)来说，Alphabet意味着抛下管理企业的烦恼，成为一个全职发明家和风险投资家，谷歌的领导权则交由桑德尔皮查伊(Sundar Pichai)。对于员工而言，Alphabet带来了提高认股权价值的希望。对于华尔街，Alphabet更加清晰明了。
Only governance renegades would invent a structure with one board for Google and Alphabet, the founding triumvirate — Eric Schmidt, Sergey Brin and Mr Page — stacked above Mr Pichai, and Ruth Porat as chief financial officer of both. “Google is not a conventional company,” wrote Mr Brin and Mr Page in their 2004 founders’ letter, and by heavens they meant it.
只有在治理上离经叛道的管理者能发明出这种结构，谷歌和Alphabet共享一个董事会，皮查伊上面排着创业三巨头埃里克施密特(Eric Schmidt)、谢尔盖布林(Sergey Brin)和佩奇，露丝波拉特(Ruth Porat)担任两家公司的首席财务官(CFO)。布林和佩奇曾在2004年的创始人来信中写道：“谷歌不是一家传统公司。”想不到他们是认真的。
Still, being conventional is not the best way to build an innovative business or to make profits. Warren Buffett runs a unique combination of industrial conglomerate and investment fund at Berkshire Hathaway, and it has worked well for him. He made his largest ever acquisition this week, buying Precision Castparts for $32bn.
不过，坚持传统的确不是建立一个创新企业或实现盈利的最佳途径。沃伦巴菲特(Warren Buffett)掌管着一个独特的组合，他所执掌的伯克希尔哈撒韦公司(Berkshire Hathaway)结合了工业集团与投资基金业务，结果很不错。本周他做出了有生以来最大规模的收购，以320亿美元买下了精密铸件公司(Precision Castparts)。
Berkshire and Alphabet are different kinds of businesses. Mr Buffett values cash flow and mature brands; Mr Page prefers to create things. One of the purposes of this week’s reshuffle is to prove to investors that not as much as they fear is being spent on experimental start-up projects, such as Project Loon’s high-altitude balloons providing internet access to remote areas.
伯克希尔哈撒韦公司与Alphabet是不同类型的企业。巴菲特重视现金流和成熟品牌，佩奇则喜欢创造新事物。谷歌本周重组的目的之一，是想向投资者证明，花在实验性初创项目上的钱没有他们所担心的多，比如向偏远地区提供互联网接入服务的Project Loon高空气球计划。
Mr Page’s naming of Mr Buffett as a role model in providing “long-term, patient capital” to an array of businesses is not idle. He thinks that a multi-business group with a guiding intelligence at the centre can beat the single-sector company favoured by investors. The “conglomerate discount” applied by Wall Street can be defeated.
佩奇视巴菲特为榜样，称巴菲特向大批企业提供“长期以及耐心的资本”。这并非泛泛而谈，佩奇认为有着核心指导智慧的多元化企业集团，可以打败投资者所青睐的专注于单一行业的企业。华尔街所采用的“多元化企业折让”(conglomerate discount)是可以被战胜的。
In principle, that is an odd thing for Mr Page to believe. Google’s technology, after all, uses online auctions and markets — the wisdom of the crowd, not human curation. Why should conglomerates such as Alphabet, with their entrenched interests and fiefdoms, be better than capital markets at allocating capital efficiently? Does he trust in inside knowledge only when the insider is himself?
原则上，佩奇的这种想法相当奇怪。毕竟谷歌的技术所用到的在线拍卖和在线市场属于群体智慧，而不是人工筛选。为什么Alphabet这类拥有稳定的利益和市场主导地位的企业集团，在有效配置资本方面会胜过资本市场？难道只有当他自己是内部人时，他才会相信内幕消息？
But he is right. Conglomerates can outperform when they exploit their advantages and remain disciplined rather than falling prey to empire-building. Their ability to build a cadre of skilled managers and to pick the right investment projects is strongest in research-intensive industries that invest in intellectual property, which is Alphabet’s territory.
但佩奇是正确的。如果企业集团能够利用优势并遵守行为准则，不因打造商业帝国而陷入困境，是可以胜过单一公司的。在专注于知识产权的研究密集型产业——这正是Alphabet的领域——企业集团最擅长建立起经验丰富的管理骨干队伍，以及挑选合适的投资项目。
Neil Bhattacharya, a professor at Southern Methodist University in Texas, found in a study that multi-business companies ran operations more efficiently than single-sector ones. They had particular advantages in areas such as software and life sciences because managers could judge more accurately than stock markets which projects were likely to succeed.
美国德克萨斯州南卫理公会大学(Southern Methodist University)教授尼尔巴塔查里亚(Neil Bhattacharya)在一项研究中发现，多元化企业比单一企业在经营上效率更高，前者在软件和生命科学等领域具有独特优势，因为企业管理者比股市更能准确判断哪些项目可能获得成功。
This is counterintuitive, given US investors’ liking for simplicity, and view of conglomerates as inefficient. Public conglomerates in the US are valued at discounts of 10 to 15 per cent to single-sector companies, according to Boston Consulting Group — though the discount is lower in Europe, and Asian conglomerates often trade at a premium.
鉴于美国投资者喜欢简单的东西，并认为企业集团效率低下，巴塔查里亚教授的发现似乎与人们的直觉相反。根据波士顿咨询集团(Boston Consulting Group)的数据，在美国，上市企业集团的估值相对于单一企业会折让10%—15%，不过欧洲的这种估值差距要小一些，而亚洲的企业集团往往会溢价交易。
The suspicion originates in the 1970s and 1980s, the era of companies such as ITT and RJR Nabisco. Michael Jensen, a Harvard professor, later criticised the “billions in unproductive capital expenditures and organisational inefficiencies” at conglomerates, praising the trend toward “smaller, more focused, more efficient” enterprises.
怀疑始于上世纪七、八十年代，那是美国国际电话电报公司(ITT)和RJR纳比斯科(RJR Nabisco)等公司的时代。哈佛大学(Harvard University)教授迈克尔礠森(Michael Jensen)后来批评企业集团存在“数十亿非生产性的资本支出和组织效率低下现象”，赞扬了企业朝着“更小、更集中、更高效”的方向演变的趋势。
Big corporations remain prey to temptation. Boston Consulting Group found that the conglomerate discount is partly due to conservatism. They tend to invest heavily in their original businesses, which may be stagnant or in decline, while undervaluing newer divisions with more potential. Microsoft, for example, suffered from trying to reinforce its Windows franchise.
大企业依然难抵挡诱惑。波士顿咨询集团发现，造成多元化企业折让的部分原因是保守。企业集团倾向于低看拥有更大潜力的新业务，而大举投资它们最初的业务，然而这些业务可能是停滞乃至下滑的。比如，微软(Microsoft)因试图强化其Windows操作系统授权业务而受挫。
Yet even investors who are suspicious of quoted conglomerates delegate capital allocation and management oversight in private markets to informed insiders. Venture capital and private equity funds are both forms of conglomerate — they invest capital in a broad portfolio of businesses on behalf of outsiders who believe that such funds possess superior expertise.
然而，即使是对上市的企业集团抱怀疑态度的投资者，也会将私人市场上的资金配置和管理监督的事宜委派给知情的内部人士。风险资本和私人股本基金都是企业集团的形式——它们代表外部人士投资广泛的业务领域，外部人士则相信这类基金拥有出色的专业知识。
Why, though, should investors seeking exposure to new companies buy shares in Alphabet, which then channels Google’s surplus cash into its own venture and growth funds, Project Loon, self-driving cars and life sciences? They could instead invest money directly in a venture capital fund. Why take the longer and less-direct road?
尽管如此，寻求投资新企业的人为何要购买Alphabet的股票，这家集团会把谷歌的现金盈余投入到其风险项目、成长基金、高空气球计划、无人驾驶汽车和生命科学等？他们可以直接投资一个风险资本基金。为何要选择一条更远的弯路呢？
It depends on trust. Investors could also have bought shares in Precision Castparts last week for less than Berkshire Hathaway paid this week, but they do not complain because they trust Mr Buffett. Alphabet’s shareholders must believe in Mr Page and Mr Brin’s ability to use their intelligence and avoid the traditional pitfalls.
关键在于信任。在本周伯克希尔哈撒韦公司出手收购之前，投资者本来也可以在上周用更低的价格买入精密铸件公司股票，但他们并没有抱怨，因为他们信任巴菲特。Alphabet的股东必然也相信佩奇和布里有能力运用他们的智慧并避开传统的陷阱。
To judge by the shares this week, they prefer a conglomerate called Alphabet to a company that had not made plain what it was. Strange as it seems, it is a rational choice.
从本周的股价来看，比起一家没有说清楚自己是什么的公司，股东们更青睐一个叫Alphabet的企业集团。尽管似乎有点奇怪，但这是一个理性选择。
A year after it surprised the world by announcing it would turn itself into tech holding company Alphabet, the company formerly known as Google is still working on its transformation.
在宣布将转型为科技控股公司Alphabet这个震惊世人的消息一年之后，这家曾叫谷歌(Google)的公司如今仍在致力于转型之事。
The job of reshuffling its portfolio of long-shot bets into a handful of more distinct, standalone divisions — and deciding which, if any, to shed — is incomplete. Nor have the financial foundations for such a restructuring been put in place.
重组业务的工作尚未完成，它要将那些看似不大可能实现的冒险赌注分别归入几个更清晰、更独立的部门，并决定是否舍弃其中一些项目。这一套重组计划的财务基础也还没有落实。
Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, along with chairman Eric Schmidt and chief financial officer Ruth Porat, are still trying to work out the business models for some of the bets, and to set financial targets, according to people familiar with the process.
知情人士表示，两位创始人拉里?佩奇(Larry Page)和谢尔盖?布林(Sergey Brin)以及董事长艾里克?施密特(Eric Schmidt)和首席财务官露丝?波拉特(Ruth Porat)仍在努力研究其中部分项目的商业模式，并制定财务目标。
It is also unclear if or when some of these projects, from driverless cars to a healthcare arm that is trying to slow ageing, will pay off, even though the oldest ones are nearly a decade old. And there is still no external indication of how Alphabet decides where to place its bets or how wide-ranging they will be.
此外也不清楚这些林林总总的项目中——从无人驾驶汽车到一个尝试延缓衰老的医疗保健子公司——是否会有几个项目能够成功，如果有的话，什么时候能看到，其中最早的项目至今已经快十年了。Alphabet也丝毫没有流露出打算把赌注下在哪些地方、这些赌注将涉及多广范围的迹象。
Mr Page himself has been investing privately in start-ups outside the company, most conspicuously in trying to build flying cars — an idea that is too far-fetched even for the former Google, which always prided itself on taking on the biggest and riskiest ideas.
佩奇本人私下里一直在投资外部的创业型企业，最引人注目的是一家尝试制造飞行汽车的公司。改名之前的谷歌，历来对自己敢于尝试最宏伟、最冒险的想法感到自豪，但飞行汽车的构想即使对谷歌而言也显得离谱。
But none of that has damped the mood among Alphabet’s investors. Wall Street has been more than willing to indulge Mr Page and Mr Brin; and the company’s shares have risen 45 per cent in the 13 months since the pair first showed signs of bringing tighter management disciplines to their sprawling set of “moonshot” projects.
所有这些都没有影响Alphabet投资者的心情。华尔街一直非常愿意纵容佩奇和布林；自从这两人表现出将对那些庞杂的“moonshot”项目（指疯狂的不太可能实现的计划，译者注）施加更严格管理纪律的迹象以来，该公司的股价在13个月里上涨了45%。
“The history of the internet is littered with people who didn’t make bets like these and destroyed shareholder value,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
“在互联网历史上，不下这样的赌注、从而摧毁股东价值的人比比皆是，”加拿大皇家银行资本市场(RBC Capital Markets)的分析师马克?马哈尼(Mark Mahaney)说。
Yahoo, AOL and eBay are among the companies from the first wave of the internet whose relevance has faded because they failed to think hard enough about their long-term future, he said.
他说，雅虎(Yahoo)、美国在线(AOL)和eBay就是第一波互联网浪潮中，由于不认真思考长远未来而逐渐变得无足轻重的公司。
Wall Street has another reason to indulge Google’s founders. Its core internet business has surged in recent quarters, unexpectedly boosting revenues and raising profit margins.
华尔街还有迁就谷歌创始人的另一个理由。该公司的核心互联网业务在近几个季度以来大幅增长，出人意料地提振了营收，提高了利润率。
Insiders say this is partly because of a fresh focus in the Google division under its new head, Sundar Pichai. Leading Google executives are no longer distracted by Mr Page’s personal interests — bordering on obsessions — in long-range ventures that have little connection with the internet advertising business that still generates more than 99 per cent of the company’s revenues.
知情人表示，这部分是因为谷歌部门在新老板桑德尔?皮查伊(Sundar Pichai)执掌下有了新的重心，谷歌主要高管不再为佩奇近乎执念的个人兴趣而分心，他那些远大冒险计划与至今仍为公司创造99%以上收入的互联网广告业务毫无关联。
Whatever the reason, Alphabet’s money-machine has been re-energised. In the second quarter of this year, Google overtook its old rival Microsoft in revenues for the first time, and Wall Street expects its revenues to surge past $100bn for the first time next year.
无论出于何种原因，Alphabet的赚钱机器已恢复了动力。今年第二季度，谷歌第一次在营收上超越了老对手微软(Microsoft)，而华尔街预计明年其营收将首次突破1000亿美元。
None of this, however, guarantees that its search for a long-term future beyond internet advertising will yield results — or that the roughly 3 per cent of revenues spent on what it calls its “other bets” will not be money poured down the drain.
然而，这些并不能保证Alphabet在互联网广告之外探索长远未来的行动就会有结果，也不能保证投入到“其他赌注”(other bets)上约占营收3%的资金不会打水漂。
“The history of these central R&D ventures is not good,” Michael Cusumano, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says of the research labs some of the biggest tech companies have run in the past.
“这些核心研发(R&D)冒险活动的历史并不理想，”麻省理工学院(MIT)教授迈克尔?库苏马诺(Michael Cusumano)在谈起大型科技企业过去设立的一些研究实验室时表示。
The lack of a precedent for the type of tech conglomerate Google’s founders are trying to create, and the vagueness of their aims for Alphabet, could add to the risks of failure.
谷歌创始人试图打造的那种类型的科技企业集团并无先例可循，加上他们对于Alphabet的目标也很模糊，可能增加失败的风险。
Mr Page has held up Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway as a model, though Mr Cusumano says “comparisons to Berkshire Hathaway are totally inappropriate. It’s not an investment fund — that’s not what Google is.” To be worth Alphabet’s attention, its non-core activities must at some point relate to its original business, he adds.
佩奇把沃伦?巴菲特(Warren Buffett)的伯克希尔哈撒韦公司(Berkshire Hathaway)视为榜样，但库苏马诺说，“与伯克希尔哈撒韦对比根本就不合适。它不是投资基金，那并非谷歌的性质。”他接着说，值得Alphabet注意的是，它的非核心业务需要在某个时候与其老本行产生联系。
A year into the experiment, there have been signs that the soaring costs at Alphabet’s non-core businesses have at least been brought under control, though Ms Porat has warned against reading too much into short-term variations in expenses.
试验了一年之后，已有迹象表明，Alphabet非核心业务的成本大增局面起码已得到了控制，不过波拉特警告不要对费用的短期变化做太多解读。
Inside the businesses, Ms Porat’s more rigorous approach to making investment decisions has had an effect. A mid-ranking employee at one of the divisions credits her with bringing greater certainty to the internal investment process, even if part of her job is to limit some of the spending.
在公司内部，波拉特对投资决策实行更严格的方法已产生了一定效果。一个部门的中层管理者称赞她为内部投资流程带来了更大的确定性，尽管她的一部分工作是限制支出。
But while the new Alphabet structure has brought more financial control, it is still unclear how the group’s divisions will be ultimately be managed as they become more freestanding. Though there are parallels between Alphabet’s investment approach and the Silicon Valley start-up ecosystem, it remains a corporate conglomerate.
但是，尽管Alphabet的新架构已带来更多的财务控制，由于集团旗下各个部门变得更加独立，目前仍不清楚其最终将对各部门采取何种管理方式。虽然Alphabet的投资手法跟硅谷创业型企业的生态系统有些类似，但它仍是一家综合性企业集团。
The individual ventures do not have their own boards, and Alphabet has not introduced any equity arrangements to tie employees’ rewards to the success of their units — the kind of incentives that are a big attraction in joining a start-up. The company has relied instead on big cash bonuses, paid out when the newer businesses hit significant milestones, though that may not keep talent in the long term. The driverless car division has shed some of its top engineers in recent months after making big payments like these, according to a person familiar with the business.
单个冒险项目没有自己的董事会，Alphabet也没有引入任何股权安排、把员工的报酬与他们所在部门的成功挂钩——在吸引人才加入初创企业方面，这样的股权机制是一种具有很大吸引力的激励手段。相反，Alphabet依赖高额奖金，在新业务达到重要里程碑时发放，不过，这或许不利于在长期内留住人才。知情人士表示，无人驾驶汽车部门在发放大手笔奖金之后，近几个月来流失了一些顶级工程师。
“This isn’t like being in a start-up — it’s like being in a family business, with mercurial venture-capital backers,” says an employee at one of the businesses.
“这不像是在一家创业企业工作，倒像在家族企业，有反复无常的风险资本投资者，”一家Alphabet旗下企业的员工表示。
In some cases, the more rigorous analysis of Alphabet’s disparate operations has also exposed the need for different business approaches. The company’s high-speed broadband division, for example, was set up to provide more competition to rival networking companies, and to prod them to invest faster in their own fibre-optic systems, something that would help the core Google internet business.
有些情况下，对Alphabet旗下各项迥然不同的业务进行更严谨的分析表明，该公司有必要采取不同的业务模式。比如，该公司成立高速宽带部门，是为了给其他网络设备公司造成更多竞争，促使它们加快投资建设自己的光纤系统，这有利于其核心的谷歌互联网业务。
Now, as a freestanding division, the broadband business is searching for ways to reduce its hunger for capital and find new, cheaper technologies than fibre that will make it a profitable business in its own right — a hunt highlighted by its acquisition in June of the wireless internet access company WebPass.
如今，作为一个独立的部门，该宽带业务开始想方设法减轻自己对于资金的饥渴，并寻找比光纤更低成本的新技术，以期成为一项独立的盈利业务——今年6月收购无线互联网接入公司WebPass，就凸显了其对技术的追逐。
As the search for sustainable business models continues, Alphabet has held back from making any promises about when bets such as this will pay off. That makes it very different from Facebook, which has been far clearer in outlining its long-range plans, says Mr Mahaney. The social networking company has grouped its bets into ones it hopes will pay off in three, five and 10 years’ time.
在继续寻找可持续业务模式的同时，Alphabet并未就诸如此类的押注何时可能成功做出任何承诺。马哈尼说，这一点跟Facebook完全不同，后者在概述长期计划时要清晰得多。这家社交网络公司将其赌注分成若干组，希望分别在3年内、5年内和10年内取得成功。
Speaking recently at the first shareholder meeting since its formation, Mr Schmidt gave the first indication that Alphabet is also trying to come up with a more rigorous timetable. It should at least be clear within three years which of the portfolio it refers to as its “other bets” will be worth pursuing, he said.
不久前在Alphabet组建后的首届股东大会上发言时，施密特首次暗示，Alphabet也在尝试拿出一份更严格的时间表。他说，Alphabet至少要明确，在其统称为“其他赌注”的所有项目中，在3年时间跨度内哪些项目将是值得推行的。
But even if the long-term outlines and goals for Alphabet remain unclear, Wall Street is more than happy to stay patient. And if shareholders ever start to feel restless, there is always the huge profitability of the old Google business to reassure them.
但是，即便Alphabet的长期发展框架和目标仍不清晰，华尔街也非常乐于保持耐心。如果股东什么时候开始感到不安，旧有谷歌业务的巨大盈利也总会让他们放下心来。
Artificial intelligence has made history by beating humans in poker for the first time, the last remaining game in which humans had managed to maintain the upper hand.
近日，人工智能首次在打扑克上击败了人类，从而创造了历史。而打扑克也是人类设法占据上风的最后一项比赛。
Libratus, an AI built by Carnegie Mellon University racked up over $1.7 million worth of chips against four of the top professional poker players in the world in a 20-day marathon poker tournament that ended in Philadelphia.
Libratu是卡内基梅隆大学研发的一个人工智能系统，配备了价值170万美元的芯片。在于费城刚刚结束的一场为期20天的世界扑克锦标赛上，它对战了全世界最为顶尖的4名扑克选手。
While machines have beaten humans over the last two decades in chess, checkers, and most recently in the ancient game of Go, Libratus' victory is significant because poker is an imperfect information game - similar to the real world where not all problems are laid out and the difficulty in figuring out human behavior is one of the main reasons why it was considered immune to machines.
尽管过去20年里人工智能已经在象棋、跳棋、以及最近的围棋中把人类打得一败涂地，但Libratus的胜利却有着更加重大的意义，因为扑克牌是一种不完全信息博弈游戏，和真实世界很相似，不是所有问题都摆在明面上，而在识别人类行为方面的困难也是曾经认为人工智能不可能在扑克上赢过人类最主要的原因之一。
"The best AI's ability to do strategic reasoning with imperfect information has now surpassed that of the best humans," said Tuomas Sandholm, professor of computer science at CMU who created Libratus with a PhD student Noam Brown said.
和一位名叫诺姆·布朗的博士生学生共同研发出Libratus的卡内基梅隆大学计算机科学教授图奥马斯·桑德霍尔姆表示：“在不完全信息情况下，最好的人工智能做策略推理的能力现在已经超过了最好的人类。”
The victory prompted inquiries from companies all over the world seeking to use Libratus' algorithm for problem solving.
这场胜利导致世界各地的公司发来询问，希望寻求用Libratus的算法来解决问题。
"It can be used in any situation where information is incomplete including business negotiation, military strategy, cyber security and medical treatment," Sandholm said.
桑德霍尔姆说道：“它可以用于任何信息不完全的情况，包括商务谈判、军事战略、网络安全和医疗。”
One of the main reasons for Libratus' victory was the machine's ability outbluff humans.
Libratus取得胜利的一个主要原因是在打牌时用下大注的方法吓退人类。
"The computer can't win at poker if it can't bluff," said Frank Pfenning, head of the Computer Science Department at CMU. "Developing an AI that can do that successfully is a tremendous step forward scientifically and has numerous applications."
卡内基梅隆大学计算机科学系主任弗兰克·普芬宁表示：“如果计算机不能虚张声势的话，就不可能在扑克上赢。研发一个可以成功做到那一点的AI是一个巨大的科学进步，很多地方都可以用到这一点。”
Google's artificial intelligence (AI) program AlphaGo on Tuesday triumphed in its final game against South Korean Go grandmaster Lee Sedol to win the five-game series 4-1.
周四，谷歌人工智能程序AlphaGo在与韩国围棋高手李世石的最后一场比赛中获胜，最终以4-1的比分赢得这场总计五局的人机大赛。
Lee Se-dol, one of the world's top Go players, won just one of the matches against the AlphaGo program, missing out on the $1m prize up for grabs. Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind, said the match had been the "most exciting and stressful" for his team.
世界顶级围棋选手之一的李世石，在与AlphaGo程序的较量中只赢了一场，从而与100万美元的奖金失之交臂。DeepMind创始人戴密斯·哈萨比斯则称这一系列赛对于他的团队来说是“最令人激动和紧张”的。
Lee said he felt "regrettable" about the result of the contest after the game.
赛后，李世石表示对比赛结果感到"遗憾"。
At a press conference held after the final match, Mr Lee said he did not necessarily think AlphaGo was superior to humans. But he said he had more studying to do, and admitted the matches had challenged some of his ideas about the game Go.
在最后一场比赛结束之后的新闻发布会中，李世石表示，他并不认为AlphaGo优于人类。但他也表示自己有很多功课要做，并承认这次比赛改变了他对围棋的一些想法。
One South Korean newspaper complained that the contest was "lopsided" with the single Korean pitted against the corporate might of Google and its "army of super-smart people armed with unfathomable computing power".
一家韩国报纸对此抱怨称，这场比赛是一个孤军奋战的韩国人来和整个谷歌公司的力量以及“一群有着深不可测的计算机实力的超级聪明人”的较量，而这显然是不公平的。
In a spirit of magnanimity, however, the Korea Baduk Association - which governs the game of Go - has decided to give an honorary ninth-dan ranking to AlphaGo.
然而，秉持着大度的精神，管理围棋的韩国棋院决定授予AlphaGo名誉职业九段的排名。
The 4-1 mechanical victory has also made some Go players doubt themselves. Go was invented about 2,500 years or so ago in China. Until now, it has always had a human best player. Not any more.
这场4比1的机械性胜利也让一些围棋选手产生自我怀疑。围棋在大约2500年前起源于中国。之前，最好的棋手都是人类。但再也不是了。
AlphaGo's win over Lee is significant because it marks the first time an AI program has beaten a top-ranked Go professional, a victory experts had predicted was still years away.
AlphaGo战胜李世石一役意义重大，因为这标志着人工智能程序首次击败顶尖围棋职业选手。此前专家预计数年后才会出现这样的结果。
AlphaGo is now the world's No 1 Go player, ending thousands of years of human dominance in the game.
AlphaGo现在已经成为世界第一围棋手，结束了几千年的人类在该棋类的统治地位。
According to the latest GoRating, AlphaGo replaced Chinese player Ke Jie to become the world's No 1, the first nonhuman to win the honor.
根据GoRating的最新排名，人工智能围棋程序AlphaGo取代中国棋手柯洁，成为世界第一的围棋选手，是非人类首次获此殊荣。
AlphaGo is an artificial intelligence (AI) Go-playing program designed by Google DeepMind, a British artificial intelligence company. It beat South Korean Go master Lee Sedol by 4 to 1 in a challenge match in March, causing a sensation around the world.
AlphaGo是由谷歌旗下的英国人工智能公司DeepMind开发的。在3月份的一场挑战赛中，AlphaGo以4比1击败韩国围棋大师李世石，震惊世界。
Rumors said AlphaGo would face off against Ke Jie after beating Lee, but this was denied by DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis.
有传言称AlphaGo将迎战曾击败李世石的柯洁，但是该消息已经被DeepMind公司的联合创始人德米什·哈萨比斯否认。
According to GoRating rules, a player's score on the list will change according to that of his opponent. For example, AlphaGo will see its score going up if Lee Sedol's score increases.
根据GoRating的规则，棋手在榜单上的成绩将根据其对手成绩的变化而变化。例如，如果李世石的成绩提高，则AlphaGo的成绩也会随之提高。
Defeating a human Go master is not the only thing AI can achieve. DeepMind also plans to apply its AI technology to improve human well-being, including promoting healthcare in cooperation with the National Healthcare Service.
击败一名人类围棋高手，并不是人工智能唯一能做到的事情。DeepMind公司也计划应用人工智能技术，通过与国家医疗服务合作，来促进医疗保健，进而提升人类的幸福。
Global AI revenue is expected to reach 119 billion yuan (US$18.1 billion) in 2020, an average annual growth rate of 19.7 percent from 2015, according to a report by consulting firm iResearch.
根据艾瑞咨询的一项报告指出，按照2015年的19.7%的年均增长率，全球人工智能收入在2020年预计将达到1190亿元（折合181亿美元）。
Google’s AlphaGo computer system sealed a 4-1 victory over a South Korean Go grandmaster on Tuesday, in a landmark moment for the development of artificial intelligence.
周二，谷歌(Google)的AlphaGo计算机系统以4比1的总比分战胜了韩国围棋大师李世石(Lee Se-dol)。这是人工智能发展中的一个里程碑时刻。
Mastery of the east Asian game of Go was long seen as a stern challenge for computers given its huge complexity. AlphaGo’s creators estimate that there are about 250 potential moves at each point of a game, against 35 in chess, yielding a possible number of board configurations of 10 squared by 170.
鉴于围棋极其复杂，长期以来，精通围棋一直被视为计算机面临的一项严峻挑战。AlphaGo的创建者估计，围棋的每一步都有250种可能走法（国际象棋只有35种），产生的可能局面数量为10的170次方。
Lee Se-dol, arguably the best player of the past decade, had expected to win a crushing victory, arguing that AlphaGo lacked the “intuition” needed to beat him. But the program won the first three games in the series, which began last Wednesday, before Mr Lee clawed back a victory on Sunday.
李世石可以说是过去10年最棒的围棋手，他曾预计自己会取得压倒性胜利。他认为，AlphaGo缺少击败他所需的“直觉”。但在上周三开始这场对决中，计算机程序赢了前三局，而后李世石在上周日扳回一局。
Tuesday’s final game was one of the closest: AlphaGo recovered from an early error to force Mr Lee into resignation in overtime, with each player having used up the allotted two hours.
周二的最后一局是双方拼杀得最难解难分的一局：AlphaGo起先出现了一次失误，但后来挽回了局面，把李世石拖入读秒，李世石在读秒阶段投子认输。双方都用尽了分配给自己的两小时。
The victory demonstrates the power of the “deep learning” systems employed by AlphaGo’s creators at DeepMind, a London-based start-up acquired by Google two years ago.
AlphaGo的胜利证明了创建者使用的“深度学习”系统的威力。AlphaGo是由谷歌在两年前收购的伦敦创业型企业DeepMind创建的。
Go’s huge complexity rules out the “brute force” approach of IBM’s Deep Blue chess computer, which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 by evaluating 200m positions per second. Instead, AlphaGo learned to recognise promising moves by playing huge numbers of Go matches against itself.
围棋的巨大复杂性超出了IBM深蓝(Deep Blue)国际象棋计算机“蛮力”方法的处理能力。1997年，每秒评估2亿步的深蓝战胜了加里?卡斯帕罗夫(Garry Kasparov)。AlphaGo则是通过自己跟自己大量对弈，学会了如何推测对手可能的走法。
Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s chief executive, said the series would enable his team to make further improvements to the system, which had some flaws exposed during the contest — notably when an unorthodox move by Mr Lee in the fourth match prompted AlphaGo to make a series of amateurish blunders.
DeepMind首席执行官杰米斯?哈萨比斯(Demis Hassabis)表示，此次对弈将使他的团队能对AlphaGo系统进行更多改进。该系统在对弈过程中暴露出了一些缺陷——尤其是在第四局中，李世石走出了反常规的一步，导致AlphaGo出现一连串业余选手般的失误。
The system’s log showed that it had assessed the likelihood of Mr Lee’s move at less than one in 10,000, Mr Hassabis tweeted on Tuesday.
周二，哈萨比斯在Twitter上发帖称，系统日志显示，AlphaGo认为李世石走出那一步的可能性低于万分之一。
Mr Lee, meanwhile, refused to concede that the era of human supremacy in Go was at an end. “I don’t necessarily think AlphaGo is superior to me — there’s more that a human being can do against artificial intelligence,” he said. “I don’t feel this was a loss for human beings. It showed my weaknesses, not the weaknesses of humanity.”
李世石拒绝承认人类统治围棋的时代已经终结。“我并不完全认为AlphaGo比我高明——人类在对抗人工智能方面还能做得更多。”他说，“我不认为这是人类的失败。它暴露出了我个人的弱点，而非人类的弱点。”
Google’s computer program AlphaGo has defeated the world’s best Go player in the second out of three games, scoring an overall win for the artificial intelligence algorithm in the fiendishly complex board game.
谷歌(Google)电脑程序AlphaGo在三局比赛的第二局战胜世界排名第一的围棋选手，意味着人工智能算法在这种极其复杂的棋盘游戏领域大获全胜。
Chinese champion Ke Jie gave up on Thursday after both the computer and human surprised the audience with their innovative strategies.
中国围棋冠军柯洁周四投子认负，这场对弈中电脑和人脑都以创新的战术给观众带来了惊喜。
Although the ancient board game of Go has few rules, its complexity means it had been considered unimaginable for a computer to beat a human champion. However, AlphaGo, developed by Google’s DeepMind unit, beat the South Korean grandmaster Lee Se-dol last year.
尽管古老的围棋规则很少，但其复杂性意味着电脑击败世界冠军曾被认为是难以想象的。然而，由谷歌旗下的DeepMind公司开发的AlphaGo去年击败了韩国围棋大师李世石(Lee Se-dol)。
Google brought AlphaGo to China in order to challenge Mr Ke and showcase its AI breakthroughs in front of local experts and government officials at a five-day tournament. The competition is the company’s biggest event in collaboration with the Chinese government since its search engine was blocked seven years ago.
谷歌将AlphaGo带到中国的目的是，挑战柯洁并在为期5天的赛事中在中国专家和政府官员面前展示其在人工智能领域的突破。自其搜索引擎7年前在中国被屏蔽以来，这是谷歌与中国政府合作举办的规模最大的活动。
This year’s version, called AlphaGo Master, is even stronger than last year’s, explained Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind.
DeepMind联合创始人杰米斯?哈萨比斯(Demis Hassabis)解释道，今年的版本名为AlphaGo Master，比去年的版本更为强大。
AlphaGo Master is able to learn from playing itself, rather than needing to learn from human games. It is also more efficient, requiring 10 times less computing power than the previous version.
AlphaGo Master能够从与自己对弈中学习，而不是需要从人类比赛中学习。其效率也更高，需要的计算能力是上一个版本的10分之一。
“The main innovation is that AlphaGo has become its own teacher,” said Dave Silver, lead programmer on AlphaGo. “This makes it learn in a much more general way, meaning it does not only play Go better, but could lead to more general applications.”
“主要的创新是AlphaGo已变成自己的老师，”AlphaGo首席程序员戴夫?西尔弗(Dave Silver)表示，“这令其能够用更一般化的方式学习，意味着不仅棋艺增强，而且还能带来更一般化的应用。”
AlphaGo Master also runs on better hardware. It uses “tensor processing units”, microchips that Google has designed for use with AI programs. According to Google, TPUs can perform up to 80 times better per unit of energy used compared with conventional chips.
AlphaGo Master的硬件也更好了。它使用“张量处理单元”，这是谷歌为用于人工智能程序而设计的微芯片。据谷歌称，“张量处理单元”每单位能量的性能优于常规芯片最多80倍。
In a case of man imitating machine, Mr Ke started using strategies learnt from watching AlphaGo’s matches.
柯洁也开始使用从观看AlphaGo比赛中学到的战术，表明人类也在模仿机器。
Although IBM’s Deep Blue beat the chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, advancements in cracking Go have been more difficult.
尽管IBM的“深蓝”(Deep Blue)计算机在1997年击败了国际象棋冠军加里?卡斯帕罗夫(Garry Kasparov)，但要在攻克围棋领域取得进展更为困难。
Unlike chess, Go cannot be won easily by using brute power to work out all the possible moves. Instead, AlphaGo uses styles of learning that mimic the way neurons work in the human brain.
与国际象棋不同，围棋不可能通过利用纯粹的计算能力计算出全部可能的走法来轻易取胜。AlphaGo采用的学习模式是模仿神经元在人类大脑中的工作原理。
DeepMind is now working on developing programs to play games that require more complex visual input, such as Blizzard Entertainment’s online strategy game Starcraft.
DeepMind现在正致力于开发程序来玩需要更复杂视觉输入的游戏，例如暴雪娱乐(Blizzard Entertainment)的在线策略游戏《星际争霸》(Starcraft)。
Lee Se-Dol is the world champion of Go, the ancient Chinese board game that is considered the world’s most complex. This week, the South Korean took on an artificially intelligent computer program called AlphaGo created by DeepMind, a British company owned by Google.
李世石(Lee Se-Dol)是围棋世界冠军。围棋这种古老的中国棋盘游戏，被认为是世界上最复杂的棋类游戏。上周，这位韩国棋手与谷歌(Google)旗下的英国公司DeepMind研发的人工智能计算机程序AlphaGo展开对弈。
In the series of five matches in Seoul, the machine is winning, taking a 2-0 lead in the contest.
在这场于首尔举行的五局对弈中，AlphaGo目前以3：1领先。
The victories have a human mastermind in Demis Hassabis, co-founder and chief executive of DeepMind. He describes Mr Lee as the “Roger Federer of Go”, and for some the computer program’s achievement is akin to a robot taking to the lawns of Wimbledon and beating the legendary tennis champion.
AlphaGo背后的人类策划者是DeepMind的共同创始人兼首席执行官杰米斯?哈萨比斯(Demis Hassabis)。他把李世石形容为“围棋界的罗杰?费德勒(Roger Federer)”，因此对一些人来说，AlphaGo的成就类似于一台机器人站上了温布尔登的草坪并战胜了这位网球传奇冠军。
“I think it is pretty huge but, ultimately, it will be for history to judge,” says Mr Hassabis, speaking to the Financial Times from Seoul, where the matches are taking place. “Many people predicted it was at least a decade away so we’re thrilled to have achieved this milestone.” The 39-year-old has long dreamt about the victory. But his ambitions stretch beyond the Go board. His aim is to make “machines smart”.
我认为这是一个大事件，但是，最终还是要留给历史来评判，”哈萨比斯在首尔接受英国《金融时报》(Financial Times)采访时称，“很多人之前预言至少还需要10年才能实现这一成就，所以我们对于达到这一里程碑感到很兴奋。”39岁的哈萨比斯长久以来一直梦想着这场胜利。但是他的雄心已经不仅限于围棋的棋盘。他的目标是“让机器变聪明”。
The London-born son of a Chinese-Singaporean mother and a father of Greek-Cypriot descent, Mr Hassabis is a modern polymath whose career path has seen him become a chess prodigy, master computer programmer, video games designer and neuroscientist.
哈萨比斯出生于伦敦，母亲是新加坡华人，父亲有希腊裔塞浦路斯人血统。他是现代版的通才博学家，既是国际象棋神童、大师级的计算机程序员，还是视频游戏设计师和神经学家。
These experiences led him to create DeepMind in 2010, alongside Mustafa Suleyman, a technologist and childhood friend of Mr Hassabis, and Shane Legg, whom he met when they were postgraduates studying neuroscience at University College London. The artificial intelligence group was acquired by Google for ￡400m in 2014.
这些经历使得他在2010年与穆斯塔法?苏莱曼(Mustafa Suleyman)和谢恩?列格(Shane Legg)一起创建了DeepMind。苏莱曼是一位技术专家、哈萨比斯的童年好友，而列格是哈萨比斯在伦敦大学学院(University College London)读神经学研究生时的同学。2014年，谷歌以4亿英镑的价格收购了这家人工智能公司。
“What is even more unusual about Demis is people that gifted can be difficult to mix with,” says Hermann Hauser, the computer scientist and entrepreneur. “But he’s very open, generous and humble. There is no arrogance on display.”
“让杰米斯更加与众不同的是，天才往往很难相处，”计算机科学家和企业家赫尔曼?豪泽(Hermann Hauser)称，“但是他很开朗、大度又谦逊，一点都不傲慢。”
Mr Hassabis was introduced to artificial intelligence while studying computer science as an undergraduate at Cambridge university. Lecturers insisted on teaching “narrow” AI, where programmers attach “labels” to data for a computer to make sense of information.
哈萨比斯本科在剑桥大学(Cambridge University)学习计算机科学时接触到了人工智能。当时大学讲师坚持传授有关“弱”人工智能的知识，即程序员为数据添加“标签”让计算机理解信息。
Mr Hassabis was unsatisfied by this approach. He wanted to create “general” AI systems that use “unstructured” information from their surroundings to make independent decisions and predictions.
哈萨比斯对这种方式并不满意。他希望打造“强”人工智能系统，后者能够利用来自周围环境的“非结构化”信息独立决策并作出预判。
At DeepMind, engineers have created programs based on neural networks, modelled on the human brain. These systems make mistakes, but learn and improve over time. They can be set to play other games and solve other tasks, so the intelligence is general, not specific. This AI “thinks” like humans do.
在DeepMind，计算机工程师在模拟人类大脑的神经网络的基础上创建程序。这类系统会犯错误，但是会随着时间的推移学习和提高。可以对它们进行设定，让它们玩其他游戏和完成其他任务，因此这种人工智能是通用而非专用的，会像人类一样“思考”。
Games are an ideal way to test such AI programs, allowing researchers to measure performance against set goals. And Mr Hassabis is ideally placed to train the computer. A chess master by age 13 and a competitor at the Mind Sports Olympiad, he is remembered for dashing between matches to battle various competitors at once. Organisers have described him as “probably the best games player in history”.
游戏是测试此类人工智能程序的理想方式，让研究人员能够将程序在游戏中的表现与设定目标相比较。而哈萨比斯非常适合训练计算机。作为一名13岁就获得国际象棋大师称号并参加了智力奥运会(Mind Sports Olympiad)的选手，他因在赛场间奔跑、同时与不同选手对弈而被人铭记。组织者认为他“或许是史上最佳选手”。
Mr Hassabis enjoys games filled with human randomness. He has won poker tournaments and says he enjoys the game because players can make all the right moves and still lose. He likes Diplomacy, a fraught game with loose rules, where players need to negotiate deals, forge alliances and backstab each other to secure world domination.
哈萨比斯喜欢玩人性随机性强的游戏。他赢过扑克锦标赛，并表示他喜欢这种游戏是因为选手们可能每步都正确，但仍会输掉比赛。他喜欢玩《外交》(Diplomacy)这款有着松散规则却精彩纷呈的游戏，在这款游戏中，选手们为了称霸世界，需要讨价还价、缔结联盟、互相背后捅刀子。
Go is the “holy grail” for AI. The game originated 2,500 years ago in China, is played by 40m people worldwide and has 1,000 professional players.
围棋是人工智能的“圣杯”。围棋在2500年前起源于中国，如今全世界有4000万人下围棋，有1000名专业选手。
“I know how to play Go well enough to be able to appreciate its beauty,” Mr Hassabis says. “But it is not one of the games I’m strong at, so I’ve not actually played AlphaGo myself as it surpassed my ability almost from the beginning.”
哈萨比斯表示：“我的围棋水平足以让我欣赏它的美。但围棋不是我的强项，因此我没有亲自与AlphaGo对弈过，因为几乎从一开始我就不是对手。”
Computers have long “solved” other games like backgammon and draughts. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer beat Garry Kasparov, the then world chess champion. With Deep Blue, programmers built a system that tried to analyse every outcome of every possible move. But Go is far more complex than chess. There are more possible configurations on a Go board than atoms in the universe. This is too much information for even the most powerful supercomputer to process. Beating the best human player required an unprecedented technological breakthrough.
计算机早就“解决了”诸如步步高和跳棋之类的其他游戏。1997年，IBM的“深蓝”(Deep Blue)超级计算机击败了当时的国际象棋世界冠军加里?卡斯帕罗夫(Garry Kasparov)。程序员用深蓝打造了一个试图分析每一种可能走法的所有结果的系统。但围棋要远比国际象棋复杂得多。围棋的棋局变数比宇宙中的原子数量还要多。即便是最强大的超级计算机也无法处理这么多的信息。击败最强的人类选手需要史无前例的技术突破。
That moment came on Wednesday when, after three-and-a-half hours play, Mr Lee conceded to AlphaGo. The human champion was in “shock” after the loss. The next day the computer won again. The third match begins this weekend. Though marvelling at this achievement, Mr Hauser warns that progress in other fields, such as robotics, is some way off.
突破的时刻在上周三来临——在3个半小时的对弈之后，李世石向AlphaGo认输。这位人类冠军棋手在输棋之后感到“震惊”。第二天AlphaGo再次获胜。尽管对这一成绩感到惊叹，但哈萨比斯警告称，机器人技术等其他领域还有很长的路要走。
“One of the curiosities of the phenomenal progress we’re making with AI is that it looks as though we have a world champion at Go, but we don’t have a computer that can physically move the Go pieces,” he says. Mr Federer will not face a similar challenge just yet.
他说：“我们在人工智能领域取得的重大进展的一个古怪之处在于，看起来我们有了一个名叫AlphaGo的世界冠军，但我们还没有一台能够在实体棋盘上落子的计算机。”费德勒目前还不会面临类似的挑战。
For Mr Hassabis, creating machines that beat humans in games is just a testing ground before unleashing DeepMind’s technology on “real world challenges like making smartphone assistants smarter, and further in the future, using it to help scientists solve some of society’s most pressing problems in healthcare and other areas”.
对哈萨比斯来说，创造在游戏中击败人类的机器只是个试验，是为了以后利用DeepMind的技术，“解决让智能手机助手更智能等真实世界的挑战，并在将来，利用这种技术帮助科学家们在医疗和其他领域解决一些最为紧迫的社会问题”。
Last October, Lisa Su became the first female leader of a major semiconductor company. As Advanced Micro Devices AMD 1.16% new CEO, the long-time technologist also became one of the 25 women CEOs in the Fortune 500. She has since spent the past few months trying to get the company—which, like larger rival Intel, has suffered from slumping PC sales—back on a path of profitable growth. To explain how she plans to do that (and to share her thoughts on breaking the glass ceiling at AMD and her passion for gaming), Su sat down for an exclusive interview with Fortune this week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
去年十月，苏姿丰成为一家大型半导体公司的首位女性掌门人。作为超威半导体（AMD）的新CEO，这位经验丰富的技术专家也由此成为《财富》500强企业中仅有的25名女性CEO之一。过去几个月，她一直试图令超威重返盈利轨道，因为超威像英特尔一样，近来也遭受了PC销量下滑的冲击。上周，苏姿丰在拉斯维加斯的CES展上接受了《财富》的独家专访，详解了她的公司复兴计划，她对自己在超威打破女性职业晋升瓶颈的看法，以及她对游戏的热情。
Edited excerpts:
以下是经过编辑的采访摘要：
FORTUNE: You’re a few months in to the job now. What do you hope to do, and what’s the plan?
《财富》：你上任已经几个月了。你打算做些什么？你的计划是什么？
Lisa Su:It’s been just about 90 days, and it’s been fabulous. I have been with the company for a couple of years and in the semiconductor industry for over 20 years. It is incredibly fun to run a company like AMD. I’ve spent most of the last quarter on the road. So that’s a lot of time with customers and partners and employees. The most interesting thing is just talking about the technology and why it’s exciting and important and we’re going with it. I grew up as a technology geek, and now I get to live the part for real.
苏姿丰：差不多90天了，感觉非常好。我已经在这家公司工作几年了，在半导体行业也已经摸爬滚打了20多年。运营像超威这样一家公司是非常有意思的。上个季度的大部分时间，我都在路上，花了很多时间见客户、合作伙伴和员工。最有意思的事就是讨论技术，它为什么令人兴奋，为什么重要，我们为什么要做它。我从小就是个“极客”，而现在它成了我的生活。
Semiconductors have always been my background, so building chips and seeing the product of our designs go into devices is really cool for me. I think the vision that I’m trying to establish for AMD is that we are a company with technology that’s really, really leading edge, and we’re going into the most important applications over the next five years. So 50 billion devices will be connected together and there will be all different types of devices. You’ll have PCs and cars and more, and all of them need computing and visualization. That’s what we do.
我的背景一直是半导体，所以我觉得，生产芯片、看着我们设计的产品进入电子设备，是一件很酷的事。我认为我想为超威建立的愿景就是，我们是一家技术非常先进的公司，而且我们要做的正是未来五年里应用最广的东西。未来联网的设备将达到500亿台，而且也将会有各种不同的设备。比如说，你的PC和汽车都需要计算和虚拟化。那就是我们要做的事情。
How can you differentiate the company going forward?
展望未来，你如何让这家公司实现差异化？
Diversifying the business is definitely a good thing. But for me, it’s really about product applications and what we can enable and inspire. I think AMD is at our best when we’re working with a customer and allowing them to do something they couldn’t do before. That is not the history of the company—the history of the company is that we’ve been second source to other people. I think we really need to change that, that’s the nugget I’d like to change. Two years from now if we’re sitting here, you should be thinking, “Hey, these are all the cool things that AMD is in”—not that AMD is a second source to somebody else.
让业务多样化绝对是一件好事。但在我看来，更重要的是产品的应用，以及我们能够促成什么、启发什么。我认为超威正处于最好的时期，因为我们能让客户做一些以前做不了的事情。那并不是公司的历史——我们过去一直被很多人视为第二选择。我认为我们确实需要改变这一点。两年后如果我再坐在这里，你应该会想：“嘿，这么多非常酷的东西都有超威参与。”到那时，超威将不再是位于其它公司之后的第二选择。
So what kind of cool things, for example?
你们正在参与开发哪些非常酷的产品，能举个例子吗？
Like the iMac 5K display. It has all of the technology that we can pack and graphics and visualization in a beautiful form factor. Also game consoles—that’s really a product that enables so much. I happen to have lots of game consoles in my house, and for our holiday party we did Just Dance [a “rhythm game” developed and published by Ubisoft]. It’s not a fighter game, but it’s a different way of socializing and bringing technology to the forefront. I think that’s what I’d like AMD to be known for—you know, we bring cool applications to the market.
比如iMac 5K显示器。它集成了我们现有的全部技术，还有图形和虚拟化等等，而且外形也很漂亮。此外还有游戏机，它是一个具有很大潜能的产品。我家里就有很多游戏机，在家里开假日派对的时候，我们就会玩《舞力全开》（一款由Ubisoft公司开发的“旋律游戏”）。它不是一个对战游戏，而是一种全新的社交方式，而且把科技推到了前沿。我想这就是我希望超威能够享有的声誉——你知道，我们会把很酷的应用推向市场。
You’ve been in the industry for a long time. How has it changed? There seems to be a changing of the guard at a lot of companies at the moment and rapid technology changes.
你进入这个行业已经很长时间了，它有什么变化吗？目前似乎有许多公司都更换了掌门人，而且技术变革的速度也非常快。
The pace of change has increased. It’s not measured on years anymore; you can actually see it in a shorter time scale. Putting management changes aside—because every company has management changes and that’s not necessarily the primary factor—the market is changing and it’s because the technology is changing so fast. If you think about the period of time between when we went from PCs being the center of the universe to smartphones to tablets to now, where it’s not any one of those things but really a collection of hundreds of devices that have become important, I think it’s really because those changes have accelerated that it causes us as technology people to be much smarter or more predictive of what has to happen. Because when we make an investment in technology today it will take us three years to see if it will pay off. So we have to be predicting what will happen three years from now.
变革的速度已经加快了。它不再是按年来计算，你可以在更短的时间周期看到变革。先把管理层更换放在一边——因为每家公司都有管理层变革，那未必是一个主要因素。市场也在发生变化，因为技术的变革实在太快了。想想我们从PC过渡到智能手机和平板电脑再到现在所用的时间，特别是现在这些东西中没有任何一项占统治地位，而是几百种设备都变得很重要，我想这的确是因为这些变化已经加速，它使我们这些搞科技的人变得更聪明了，或者更能预见到下一步会发生什么。因为如果我们今天做出一项技术投资，三年就可以见到效果。所以我们必须能够预测三年后会发生什么。
I joke about this but a lot of people ask me why AMD isn’t in smartphones. I say, “That’s an interesting question but you should have asked me that three years ago.” What you should be asking me today is what’s going to be important three years from now. That’s the part of our industry that I think makes it so interesting to be in, because the important money is what are we investing in in the future.
我曾开玩笑地说起这一点，但很多人问我，为什么超威没有进入智能手机行业。我说：“这是一个很有意思的问题，但你应该在三年前问我。”你今天问我的问题应该是三年以后什么最重要。这正是为什么我觉得这个行业非常有意思，因为重要的是我们未来要投资什么。
But there’s still a lot of money in mobile. Was the decision not to be there a mistake?
但目前还是有很多资金投在了移动上，没有进入移动领域是不是一个错误？
I think the decision was one that was made three years ago. And I view it as, you have to play to your strengths. There are a lot of phones that are going to be sold and that’s good. But our strengths are in computing and visualization. So playing to our strengths is key.
我想这个决定是三年前做出来的。我认为我们必须扬长避短。虽然卖出去的手机的确很多，这也很好，但我们的优势在于计算和虚拟化，所以发挥优势很关键。
AMD is in two very large markets [PCs and gaming] but not dominant in either. Is that a problem?
超威同时在两个非常大的市场里博弈（PC和游戏），但没有主宰其中任何一个。这是不是一个问题？
The way I think about it is that I would probably define the markets differently as we go forward. The market is going to be defined by those 50 billion connected devices. So the question is does it end up being that there’s a set of applications where different technologies are satisfying different applications. I think AMD has a set of technologies that can service a broad number of those applications. It’s different than if we’re talking about microscopic changes on a quarterly basis. There you tend to get into who lost and gained a percentage point of market share.
我对这个问题的看法是，随着公司的进一步发展，我可能会对市场做不同的定义。未来市场将由那500亿台联网设备来定义。所以问题是，未来会不会演变成有很多的应用，需要各种不同的技术满足不同的应用。我认为超威就有一系列不同的技术，可以满足大量应用。它与那种按季度衡量的“小步快走”的变革是不同的。在后者的语境中，你可能会更关注谁赢谁输，或者占了多少市场份额。
So you’re saying that who’s going to be dominant could be different because the market categories could be different?
所以你是说，市场的主宰者可能会变，因为市场类别本身可能会变？
Yes. I firmly believe that the innovation in computing is still really in its infancy. As good as our phone is today, the speech recognition and the face recognition isn’t very good today. So there’s still plenty of innovation to be had.
是的。我坚信计算领域的创新仍然处于早期阶段。虽然现在你的手机已经挺不错了，但语音识别和面部识别功能仍然不是很好。所以还有很多的创新要做。
Is running this company something you always aspired to do?
执掌这家公司是不是你一直渴望做的事情？
It’s definitely something I aspired to do. I went to school at MIT with a whole bunch of engineers. And then I started work one day and asked myself, “why do all of these MIT Ph.D.s work for Harvard MBAs?” Why should it be like that? I was one of those engineers who thought, “Why are these people making those dumb decisions?” So it’s fun to be the person making them. This is a fantastic opportunity.
当然这是我一直渴望的。我在麻省理工学院的很多同学都是工程师。然后有一天我开始工作了，我问自己：“为什么这么多麻省理工的博士要给哈佛的MBA打工？”为什么会是这样？另外很多工程师包括我自己都会想：“为什么这些人做的决策这么蠢？”所以自己去当决策人是挺有意思的，这是一个非常美妙的机会。
You’re also the first woman to run a major semiconductor company.
你也是第一个执掌一家大型半导体公司的女性。
I’ve heard that.
我听说了。
Is that a significant milestone to you?
这对你是一个重大的里程碑吗？
I think I’m honored by it. I’m honored more by the fact that if you had asked me what I want to be when I grew up, it would have been pretty much here. Just 90 days into a job it’s hard to talk about legacy, but what’s more important to me is that when you grade AMD, whether it’s three years from now or five years from now, you grade it on that this was a fantastic set of assets that she turned into something special. That would be a phenomenal grade to have. So that’s more important than do I happen to be the first [woman] today.
我觉得很光荣。这是因为如果你在我小时候问我，长大了想当什么，我的答案很可能就是这样一份工作。现在我上任刚刚90天，还谈不上能带给这家公司多大的影响。但当你在三年或五年以后评价超威时，如果你觉得这位CEO带来了一些特别的东西，留下了一笔很出色的资产，我就会觉得那是一个很不寻常的评价。那比我现在是不是第一位女性CEO要重要得多。（财富中文网）
Last year will long be remembered as the year when cyber attacks became front page news. No institution was spared — public companies, government agencies or non-profits. Heading into 2015, we have just reached the first mile of a race without a finish line, and time is of the essence when it comes to understanding the sophistication and complexity of cyber attacks.
2014年将因屡屡登上头条新闻的网络攻击事件而被人们长期铭记。无论是上市公司、政府机构还是非营利组织，没有哪类机构能够幸免于难。进入2015年，我们只是在维护网络安全这条永无止境的征途上前进了一小步。我们亟需理解网络攻击的复杂性，时不我待。
Most cyber attacks fall into one of three main threat types:
大多数网络攻击都可归类于以下三种主要的威胁类型：
oattacks on a network’s confidentiality, causing theft or release of secure information such as credit card or Social Security numbers;
o针对网络机密性的攻击，导致信用卡号或社会保险号等安全信息遭窃或泄露；
oattacks on a network’s availability by overwhelming it with so many requests that it renders the site inoperable, or by injecting code that redirects traffic away from the site; and
o针对网络可用性的攻击，通过发送大量请求导致网站无法访问，或插入代码改变访问页面的路径；
oattacks on a network’s physical integrity which alters or destroys computer code causing damage to the network’s infrastructure.
o针对网络物理完整性的攻击，改变或破坏计算机代码，以损毁网络基础设施。
In 2015, here are seven resolutions to help protect your company against cyber threats:
2015年，你的公司应该在免受网络威胁方面立下7项新年决心：
1. Tighten Your Vendor Network
1、管理好你的供应商网络
If there is one key takeaway from the cyber attacks of 2014 it’s that passwords are dead. Hackers gained access to Fortune 100 companies by stealing passwords and log-in credentials of smaller vendors, including air conditioning and food delivery companies. Replace your single passwords with two-factor authentication or “2FA.” A good example of 2FA is withdrawing money from an ATM – it requires two authentications — your bankcard and your password. Another example is signing on to a Bloomberg terminal, which requires a password and then, using biometrics, requires a fingerprint swipe for a second form of authentication that cannot easily be stolen. You should require 2FA of all vendors or employees who log on to your networks remotely.
要从2014年的网络攻击中总结出一个要点，那就是密码被破。黑客通过窃取空调和食品配送公司等小型供货商的密码和证书，进入了《财富》100强的公司网络。请修改你的简单密码，采用双重认证（2FA）的方式。双重认证的一个典型例子就是用银行卡从自动取款机上取钱——它需要双重认证：你的银行卡和你的密码。另一个例子是登录彭博社终端，首先你需要输入密码，然后采用生物测定学技术的系统还会要求你刷指纹进行二次认证。想要偷走指纹可不容易。你应该对所有远程进入公司网络的供应商和员工采用双重认证方式。
2. Detonate Malware
2、引爆恶意软件
“Spear Phishing” is an easy and effective way to attack a network. Hackers obtain names of your friends from your public social media accounts and then send you a personal note that appears to come from someone you know and trust. When you click on the attachment or link, the email installs “malware” on your network. A solution for malware is “detonation” software. Once an email with malware is opened but before it can leave your network with critical information, it is detonated in a “sandbox” to test whether it is being routed to an inappropriate site.
“网络钓鱼”是一种发动网络攻击的简单而有效的方式。黑客从你的社交媒体公共账户获得了你朋友的名字，并伪装成你认识且信任的人给你发私信。当你点开附件或链接，邮件就会把恶意软件装进你的网络。一种应对恶意软件的方法是安装“引爆”软件。一旦带有恶意软件的电子邮件被打开，在它把你的重要信息带走之前，这种软件会先将它扔进“沙盒”中进行引爆测试，看它是否指向了一个不正常的网站。
3. Guard Your “Crown Jewels”
3、保护你的“王冠”
What information matters the most to you? Is it a secret formula, proprietary IP, Social Security or credit card numbers, sensitive health care data or non-public financial information? Once you determine your company’s most important and sensitive information, compartmentalize it from the rest of your technology and network operations.
对你来说，什么信息最重要？是秘密配方、专有知识产权、社会保险号、信用卡号、敏感的卫生保健数据，还是非公开的财务信息？一旦你确定了公司最重要和敏感的信息，就把它与其他的技术和网络操作分离开来。
4. Develop a Cyber Attack Response Plan – Now
4、现在就准备好网络攻击应急计划
Develop a plan and practice it regularly. As part of your plan, hire a forensic investigatory firm to review your network and your response plan.
准备好应急计划并定期演练。作为计划的一部分，你应当雇佣取证调查公司来检查你的网络和应急计划。
5. Conduct “Penetration” Tests
5、进行“渗透”测试
Engage a third-party firm to conduct “penetration tests” to identify weaknesses in your company’s IT network and infrastructure. Based on the findings, make the necessary security improvements and comply with disclosure requirements. For example, the SEC has published guidance regarding the responsibilities of public companies to inform investors about cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
邀请一家第三方公司来进行“渗透测试”，找出公司信息技术网络和基础设施中的缺陷。根据结果来进行必要的安全性改进，同时遵守资料公开的要求。比如，根据美国证券交易委员会的规定，上市公司有义务告知投资者公司内部存在的网络安全漏洞，该委员会还专门就此发表了一份指南。
6. Embrace the Government
6、寻求政府的帮助
When it comes to cyber attacks, the famous saying that “we are from the government and we are here to help” couldn’t be more true. The U.S. government has been far out front of the business community in understanding the significance of cyber threats. Current and former cabinet officials have warned for years about the risk of a “cyber Pearl Harbor” or “cyber 9/11.” The Secret Service and FBI have repeatedly alerted unaware public companies that their systems were breached — even though neither agency was under any obligation to do so. Don’t wait until after an attack to build relationships with key officials at the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.
在网络攻击领域，那句著名的“我们来自政府，我们将施以援手”简直是再正确不过。在理解网络威胁的严重性方面，美国政府要远远领先于商界。现任和前任内阁官员多年来一直警告称，美国有可能遭遇“网络珍珠港”或“网络9o11”袭击。美国特勤局和联邦调查局也在不断提醒毫无觉察的上市公司，他们的系统被攻破了——尽管这些机构并没有这种义务。不要等到自己被攻击之后，才开始同联邦调查局、国土安全部和司法部的核心官员搞好关系。
7. Kick the Tires in M&A
7、从事并购交易时要审查网络安全
Traditionally, the biggest security risk in a merger or acquisition transaction was confidentiality. Increasingly, cyber risk is becoming a critical, and often overlooked, factor. Heed the Department of Homeland Security’s recent warning about cyber risks in companies that you may consider buying or investing in and conduct cyber audits as part of routine due diligence.
传统上，并购交易的最大安全隐患在于保密工作。而网络风险正日益成为其中一个重要却被忽视的因素。请注意国土安全部最近发出的网络风险警告，其中也许就包括你正考虑购买或投资的公司。请将网络安全审查作为常规尽职调查的组成部分。
In 2014, the focus of many cyber attacks was stolen credit cards and financial crime. In the future, the threat will likely escalate to physical damage of technology networks and infrastructure.
在2014年，许多网络攻击的目标都是盗窃信用卡，进行金融犯罪。在未来，这种威胁可能会逐步升级为对技术网络和基础设施的物理性破坏。
During the 2014 December holiday season, the German government reported a cyber attack that caused “massive damage” to an iron plant. Utilizing a spear phishing attack, hackers disabled the electronic controls that turned off the plant’s furnaces, causing damage to the entire plant.
在2014年12月的假日季，德国政府报道了一起导致钢铁厂“严重损毁”的网络攻击事件。黑客利用网络钓鱼攻击，使得负责关闭熔炉的电子控制系统陷于瘫痪，最终造成整个工厂严重受损。
What new forms of cyber attacks will 2015 bring? Don’t wait to find out. Start 2015 off right by implementing these resolutions to help protect your company from ever-present cyber threats.
2015年将会有什么新型的网络攻击？不要再被动地等待了。即刻实施这些新年决心，保护你的公司在2015年免受无处不在的网络威胁吧。（财富中文网）

AMD just officially unveiled its Ryzen desktop processor family, a chip that it says can compete with Intel's chips at long last. AMD's last generation of desktop chips was disappointing, and has been largely relegated to low-end computers. But Ryzen manages a 52 percent boost in instructions per cycle (IPC) over last time, which puts it on a level playing field with the best Intel has to offer.
AMD官方刚刚发布了其新一代锐龙系列桌面处理器，其性能据称能与英特尔的芯片抗衡。AMD的上一代桌面级处理器是令人失望的，其产品大都是低端机的选择。但是锐龙的IPC性能提升达到了52%，这也使得它能与最好的英特尔芯片同台竞技。
The Ryzen family will come in multiple flavors, but the high-end Ryzen 7 is shipping first. The chip has eight cores and 16 threads, and starts at $329. At the top end is the 3.6GHz (4.0GHz turbo), $499 Ryzen 7 1800X, which compares well with Intel's $1,050 i7-6900K. According to AMD's benchmarks, the 1800X ties the 6900K on singlethreaded benchmarks, and beats Intel on multithreaded performance.
锐龙系列也会分为几个档次，由高端的R7系列领衔，其拥有这八核十六线程，起售价为329美元。其中售价499美元的R7 1800X 3.6GHz(睿频4.0GHz)，将会和英特尔售价1050美元的 i7-6900K竞争。根据AMD官方跑分来看，1800X的单线程成绩与6900K相当而多线程表现更优。
AMD uses a few hundred more megahertz to get there, which means AMD isn't doing quite as much as Intel Broadwell per hertz. But it's the end result that matters, and AMD is claiming to match or beat Intel across the spectrum with better prices — the dream scenario, basically.
AMD这次用了一个略高于Intel的频率，因此它的同频性能可能不如Intel的Broadwell，但是AMD仍旧可以利用定价区间的优势与之竞争甚至取胜——当然，这一切是建立在AMD按照预定的计划做的基础上。
The new processors are available for preorder now, and will ship on March 2nd. AMD is promising to have plenty of inventory and a ton of motherboard options at launch. It's a lot of promises, AMD! Hopefully Ryzen can deliver, and we can get a real fight in the desktop market, which will be wonderful for anybody not named "Intel."
新的处理器现在已经开始预订了，将会在三月二号正式发售。AMD保证说将会有充足的库存和大量的主板发售。这真是一个了不起的承诺。希望锐龙能够尽快投入桌面级市场，这对我们所有A饭来说都是个好消息。
3 Ways Veep's Amy Brookheimer Is Every Working Woman's Hero
Amy Brookheimer为何成为职场女性的榜样
Unconscious bias really screws things up for women in the workplace, but the battle is not over just yet. Thanks to the prevalence of more leading ladies on the big screen and on TV who play strong, successful working women, the unconscious bias isn't so unconscious anymore. We'll take a look at three ways Veep's powerhouse character, Amy Brookheimer, is showing working women everywhere that being tenacious, unapologetic, and "bossy" is nothing to be afraid of in their careers.
职场中，各种无意识的偏见把女性置于不利地位，但战争还没到结束的时候。随着荧幕上流行着越来越多成功、坚强的女性形象，这些无意识的偏见开始引起人们的注意。下面我们来看下《副总统》中强势的角色——Amy Brookheimer是怎样从3方面来展示女性在职场完全无需惧怕任何固执与专横。
1. She's Fine and Dandy Being a Woman in a Man's World
1. 她在男性世界表现的既优雅又时髦
Instead of tiptoeing around her job as the right-hand woman to the President of the United States (POTUS), played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Anna Chlumsky's character, Amy, is a no-holds-barred, firecracker-of-a-woman who isn't afraid to go after what she wants in her career.
作为剧中美国总统（Julia Louis-Dreyfus饰演）的左右手，Amy（Anna Chlumsky饰演）是一个无拘无束，如小爆竹一样的女人，勇于追求自己事业中想要的一切。
Yes, Amy may be an extreme and much less sympathetic version of a tenacious working woman, but she definitely sets the bar for other career-oriented women who need a little nudge in the right direction.
是的，虽然作为职业女性，Amy有些极端也缺乏同情心，但她给那些需要推一把的职业女性设下了标杆。
2. She's a Go-Getter
2.她是一个志在必得的人
When it comes to her career, nothing stands in the way of success for Amy Brookheimer. Despite the profanity-laden dialogue that Amy and the other characters lob back and forth, it's nice to see a female lead in a popular TV series taking command of her career and not afraid to fight for what she's rightfully earned.
没有什么能阻挡她事业中想要的成功。抛开Amy和剧中其他角色抛来抛去满载亵渎的对话，看到女性在电视剧中主导自己的事业生涯，勇于为自己应得的东西斗争的角色，也是一大快事！
3. She's Not Afraid to Speak Her Mind
3.她不惧怕发表自己的意见
If there's one thing that Amy does well, it's speaking her mind to anyone and everyone, including her boss, the POTUS. The men in Veep are just as quick-witted and snarky as Amy, however, it's refreshing to see a woman holding her own, especially in such a cut-throat arena as politics. Ladies, take a lesson from other accomplished women, like Amy Brookheimer, who aren't afraid to go after what they want in life and who aren't apologetic about their success.
Amy最值得夸赞的一点就是敢于向任何人，包括她的上级——美国总统发表自己的意见。虽然剧中其他男性角色也像Amy一样思维敏捷、牙尖嘴利，但女性在竞争残酷的政坛保持己见还是很少见的。所以，姐妹们，希望你们能向像Amy Brookheimer那样有成就的女强人学习，努力争取自己应得的，不要因此感到羞愧。

Split-screen multitasking and improved notification controls are among the new features being added to the Android operating system (OS). An early build of the new OS, known as Android N, was released on Thursday for app developers to test.
据悉，分屏多任务处理和优化的通知控件等新功能被加入到了新版的安卓操作系统中。被称为安卓N的新操作系统的早期版本已经于上周四发布，并由应用开发者进行测试。
Google said it had released the beta software earlier than usual so that device manufacturers could get the finished version sooner. At the moment, fewer than 3% of Android phones run the latest OS, Marshmallow.
谷歌方面表示，比平时提早发布测试版本将会便于设备制造商能更快得到最终版本。目前，只有不到3%的安卓手机运行最新的操作系统：棉花糖。
Typically, Google discusses the next generation of its Android OS at its annual developer conference in the summer. But this year it has released a first draft earlier than expected.
通常来讲。谷歌会在每年夏季的开发者大会上讨论下一代安卓系统。但今年该公司比预期更早地发布了第一个早期版本。
"By releasing the first preview and asking for your feedback now (in March!), we'll be able to act on that feedback while still being able to hand off the final N release to device makers this summer," wrote Hiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president of Android, in a blog post.
安卓高级副总裁洛克海默在博客中写道：“通过发布第一个预览版，并于现在（3月份！）就要求你们反馈。我们就可以根据得到的反馈进行相关工作，同时也可以在这个夏天向设备制造商提交最终的N版本，”
Android N will introduce split-screen multitasking that allows people to use two apps at the same time. Information can be copied across from one app to the other. A similar feature is already available on some iOS and Windows 10 devices, and Samsung has already added the feature to some of its Android smartphones.
安卓N会推出分屏多任务处理功能，让人们可以同时使用两个应用。信息可以从一个应用程序复制到另一个。类似的功能已经适用于某些iOS和Windows 10设备，三星也已经在它的一些安卓智能手机上添加了此功能。
The new software also introduces some cosmetic changes to settings and notifications, and aims to improve battery life.
此外，这一新版本系统还引入了设置和通知控件设计上的改变，旨在提高电池寿命。
Google has traditionally named new versions of the operating system after sweet treats, as was the case with Lollipop and Marshmallow. The newest version has not yet been named but it has been suggested that Android N will be named after a popular chocolate and hazelnut breakfast spread.
谷歌向来把操作系统的新版本根据甜食来命名，比如棒棒糖和棉花糖。最新的版本还未命名，但据说安卓N将会已一种流行的榛子巧克力早餐涂抹酱命名。
"We're nut tellin' you yet," said Mr Lockheimer, possibly hinting at the name.
“我们还不会告诉你，“洛克海默先生把“不”（not）的发音发成“坚果”（nut），很可能是暗示这个名字。
In the 16th century, the clock took its first step into becoming what we now know as a wristwatch. The pocket watch was born from a practical desire for a more portable way of telling time, but it quickly became a status symbol, only to be worn by the influential or royal. Indeed, the first true wristwatch, an oblong 1812 invention by the Swiss watchmaker Breguet, was created for Caroline Murat, Queen of Naples. (Napoleon’s youngest sister was somewhat of a collector: she purchased 34 timekeeping devices from Breguet in a six-year span.)
16世纪怀表的出现，使钟表朝着如今为我们所熟知的腕表的发展方向迈出了重要一步。怀表的诞生有其实用需求的原因，因为它更加便携。但怀表很快成了一种身份的象征，只有社会名流或王公贵族才能佩戴得起。世界上第一款真正的腕表于1812年诞生，乃是瑞士宝玑公司（Breguet）的作品，它是为那不勒斯王后卡罗琳o穆拉特定做的（她是拿破仑的妹妹，也是一个钟表收藏家，六年里她一共从瑞士宝玑公司购买了34块钟表）。
In today’s world, where digital devices are ubiquitous and clocks are on everything from phones to coffeemakers, the watch is almost entirely a status symbol. An expensive watch can equally project elegance, arrogance, or convention, depending on one’s company; an inexpensive one can project humility or frugality. (Consider the narrative created when it was revealed in 2005 that Russian president Vladimir Putin wore $60,000 Patek Philippe and U.S. president George W. Bush wore a $50 Timex.) All of which prompts the questions: With the act of time-keeping commoditized, what kind of status symbol could a smart watch become? Or does it create another use case altogether?
如今智能设备已经变得无处不在，不光是手机，就连咖啡机上都可以显示时间，因此手表再次变成了一种身份的象征。一块昂贵的手表可能象征着主人的典雅、高傲或传统，一块廉价的手表可能象征着主人的勤俭或谦卑。（大家不妨回忆一下2005年一桩轶事给美俄两国总统带来的口碑：当时俄罗斯总统普京戴了一块价值6000美元的百达翡丽（Patek Philippe）腕表，而美国总统小布什则戴了一块价格仅有50美元的天美时（Timex）手表。）这些都让我们不禁想到这样一个问题：随着计时设备的商业化，智能手表将扮演什么样的身份象征？抑或它将成为与身份无关的其它东西？
The “smart watch” is no longer a new product category. Today, Qualcomm QCOM -0.21% , Pebble, and Samsung all manufacture pioneering smart devices for the wrist. For Google, however, smart watches are an altogether new direction for its Android mobile operating system. The announcement of Android Wear earlier this year signaled that Google GOOG -0.42% was getting serious about wearable devices—serious in a way that the novel Glass project did not. At its developer conference in June, Google revealed that first two Android Wear watches would begin shipping—well, today.
所谓“智能手表”已经不再是一个全新的产品类别。如今，高通（Qualcomm）、Pebble和三星(Samsung)等公司都在生产具有创新意义的智能腕表。不过对于谷歌来说，智能手表对于安卓平台仍是一个全新的发展方向。谷歌（Google）于今年早些时候发布的Android Wear平台意味着它已经开始严肃看待可穿戴设备——就连新颖的谷歌眼镜项目都不曾享受过这种待遇。在今年六月的谷歌开发者大会上，谷歌宣布其头两款安装了Android Wear的手表正好将于美国时间7月7日开始发货。
Those watches are the Samsung Gear Live, listed at $199, and LG’s G Watch, listed at $229. After testing, it is possible to get a sense of what Google is trying to accomplish with Android Wear. (It should be noted that Google severely limits what manufacturers can do to customize the operating system; as a result, both devices offer essentially the same software experience. For the purposes of this review, I consider my experience with the G Watch reflective of Android Wear in general.)
这两款智能手表分别是三星的Gear Live（售价199美元）和LG的G Watch（售价229美元）。实测一番之后，我们对谷歌寄希望于Android Wear实现什么样的目标也就大概有了初步的认识。（值得注意的是，谷歌严格限制厂商对Android Wear私自进行定制，因此这三星和LG的这两款设备的软件体验大同小异。为了行文方便，笔者仅用试用G Watch的体验来代表Android Wear的总体感觉。）
To set up Android Wear, you must first pair the watch in question to an Android device (such as a phone or tablet) running version 4.3 or above of the operating system. (Check if your Android phone is compatible by visiting this page.) Once paired, the watch will begin displaying notifications from your phone or tablet—every single one. Jarring is the only word to describe the sudden sensation of an object on your wrist vibrating for every email, Twitter mention, or text message you receive, but once you remember that you’re in control, you can limit the onslaught of alerts within a minute or two. (As a rule, the watch will vibrate with every alert displayed on your phone, but the Android Wear companion app allows you to blacklist a specific app’s notifications from also showing up on your watch.)
要安装Android Wear，你必须首先将手表与一台至少安装了安卓4.3以上的设备（比如手机或平板电脑）进行配对。配对成功后，你的手机或平板电脑上的新的通知就能够通过手表显示出来。每当有新邮件、Twitter提醒或短信到来的时候，你的手表就会震动并显示消息，给人吓一跳的感觉。但是你只需要一两分钟的设置就可以调整它的报警声。（手机每次有新的通知，手表就会默认自动震动，但是Android Wear的原生应用允许你屏蔽若干应用的通知。）
The first wave of smart watches were one-way streets of communication: a connected watch would receive and display an alert to which you could only respond using your phone. Pebble did a tremendous job laying the ground work for further interaction; Google has wisely decided to pick up where it left off. With a series of touch gestures, the Android Wear wearer can scroll through alerts and interact. I’m not ashamed to say that I found immense satisfaction in my newfound ability to discretely manage my inbox by archiving emails directly from my watch.
第一批智能手表可以说只是通讯的“单行道”。一只手表可以接收和显示手机上的通知，但要想回复的话就只能通过手机。之前Pebble公司为了给智能手表的互动功能铺平道路已经做了大量工作，而谷歌则明智地选择“接过Pebble的枪”。Android Wear的使用者可以通过手势翻动处理通知消息和互动。发现通过手表就可以直接对我的Email收件箱的内容进行归档以后，我获得了极大的满足感。
It’s not all hunky dory. Notification management falls short in some areas, particularly for Hangouts, Google’s communication tool. The quibbles are small but frequent: for example, it makes sense for a notification to disappear after you reply to a message, yet it persists until you manually clear it. And third-party apps that allow you to reply display a green check mark upon the selection of that option, rather than the usual input dialogue.
但是Android Wear也并非没有瑕疵。它的通知管理在某些地方做得仍然不足，比如不支持谷歌的通讯工具Hangouts。另外还有不少小问题，比如当你回复了一条信息之后，通知就应该自动消失，但是Android Wear上的通知却不会自动消失，而是要等你去手动清除它。另外有些第三方应用的回复栏上面会显示出一个绿色的复选框，而不是通常的输入界面。
In addition to touch input, Android Wear supports Google’s speech recognition software. I’m happy to report that it takes very little time to fire off instructions like “OK Google, remind me to flip the steaks in 7 minutes.” The same can be done to search, compose an email or text message, set a timer, or even call a Lyft car with a Batman-eqsue, “OK Google, call a car.”
除了触摸输入之外，Android Wear也支持谷歌的语音识别软件。我很高兴地发现，只需要很短的时间，它就可以识别出“OK谷歌，7分钟后提醒我给牛排翻一下面”这样复杂的指令。语音指令同样可以用在搜索、撰写邮件或短信、定闹钟甚至是在Lyft网站上打车——只要你像蝙蝠侠一样很酷地说一声：“OK谷歌，给我叫辆车。”
In testing, Android Wear’s voice commands mostly worked without issue. (An exception: when I was in a room full of screaming kids, I couldn’t get the initial “OK Google” command to work. I may be a modern-day Maxwell Smart, but I lack a cone of silence.) I regularly found myself setting or sending an item just by lifting my wrist and uttering some words. The best part: all of it was done in 10 seconds or less. (Try doing that on a smartphone.)
在实测过程中，Android Wear的语音指令大多数时候可以毫无问题地运行。（只有一个例外：当我在一个有很多“熊孩子”大喊大叫的屋子里时，机器无法识别我发出的“OK谷歌”的启动指令。虽然我可能是当代的“糊涂侦探”，但我却没有一个隔音区。）我常常只要一抬手腕，就能设置一些项目或者发送一些文字。最妙的是这些在10秒钟之内就能完成（你可以试试看在智能手机上需要多长时间）。
True, I was overcome with embarrassment the first time I caught someone looking at me as I dictated a text message to my watch. I got over it in a way that I wasn’t able to with, say, Google Glass.
我要坦白，当我第一次发现有人盯着我对一块手表喃喃自语的时候，我感觉非常尴尬，但是后来我克服了这种尴尬感。相比之下，我上次试用谷歌眼镜就没有过去这个“心理关”。
There are a number of new capabilities opening up as Android developers bundle Android Wear functionality into existing Android apps in Google’s Play Store, setting the platform apart from other smart watch offerings on the market. For example, the Fly Delta app also includes an Android Wear app: Once you pair a watch to your smartphone, the Wear app is installed and you’re able to use the screen on your wrist as your boarding pass. (Finding a TSA agent that allows you to use it, on the other hand, is another story.) I hope for a Starbucks Android Wear app with which I can display my Starbucks Card barcode for quick payment.
由于安卓开发者们给谷歌Play Store里的很多现有应用也添加了Android Wear功能，因此使这款智能手表平添了许多新的能力，也使Android Wear在目前市场上智能手表产品中一枝独秀。比如达美航空公司（Delta Airlines）出品的Fly Delta应用就包含了一个Android Wear版，一旦你把智能手表与手机进行配对，Wear版的应用就会自动安装，然后你就可以将腕表的屏幕当成登机牌来使用。（至于航空运输管理局的安检人员是否认可这张“登机牌”，那就是另外一回事了。）从我本人来说，我希望星巴克（Starbucks）也能早日推出相应的Android Wear应用，这样我就可以在智能手表上显示我的会员卡条形码来进行快速支付了。
And what about that status symbol, you ask? Though it’s far from Google’s fault, the first models of Android Wear watches lack a compelling look to serve as a replacement for more analog alternatives. LG’s G Watch looks like nothing more than a block of black plastic, while Samsung’s Gear Live offers a plastic face with a silver bezel. The watches’ hardware design clearly took a backseat to software and services. For once, that’s not OK. (The better looking, if large, Moto 360 arrives later this summer. Apple’s rumored iWatch? September, supposedly.)
再回到前文提到的身份象征问题。智能手表是否成为一种身份的象征？虽然这也不是谷歌的错，但是搭载Android Wear的第一批智能手表缺乏具有吸引力的外观，恐怕暂时难以取代传统手表。LG的G Watch看起来就像一个黑色的塑料方块，三星的智能手表则饰以银色塑料边框。这样看来，这两款手表的硬件设计显然是让位于软件和服务了。就这一点，我要给个差评。（外观更好看的摩托罗拉Moto 360智能腕表将在今年夏天上市。而传言已久的苹果iWatch据悉要等到九月份才能与消费者见面。）
But they’re headed in the right direction. There’s a lot of work yet to be done on the smart watch, and though the companies that make them aren’t quite facing the same stakes as their analog counterparts in the 16th century, there is no question that they will change the way we live our lives.
但是，它们的确是在朝着正确的方向
